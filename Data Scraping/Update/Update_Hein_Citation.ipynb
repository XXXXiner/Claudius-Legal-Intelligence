CONCLUSION.........................................................................................68\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n I. INTRODUCTION\\n A central difference between contract and property concerns the\\n freedom to \"customize\" legally enforceable interests. The law of contract\\n recognizes no inherent limitations on the nature or the duration of the\\n interests that can be the subject of a legally binding contract. Certain types\\n of promises-such as promises to commit a crime-are declared\\n unenforceable as a matter of public policy. But outside these relatively\\n narrow areas of proscription and requirements such as definiteness and\\n (maybe) consideration, there is a potentially infinite range of promises that\\n the law will honor. The parties to a contract are free to be as whimsical or\\n fanciful as they like in describing the promise to be performed, the\\n consideration to be given in return for the promise, and the duration of the\\n agreement.\\n The law of property is very different in this respect. Generally\\n speaking, the law will enforce as property only those interests that conform\\n to a limited number of standard forms. As it is stated in a leading English\\n case, \"incidents of a novel kind\" cannot \"be devised and attached to\\n property at the fancy or caprice of any owner.\"\\' With respect to interests in\\n land, for example, the basic forms are the fee simple, the defeasible fee\\n simple, the life estate, and the lease. When parties wish to transfer property\\n in land, they must specify which legal form they are using-fee simple,\\n lease, and so forth. If they fail to be clear about which legal interest they are\\n conveying, or if they attempt to customize a new type of interest, the courts\\n will generally recast the conveyance as creating one of the recognized\\n forms. Of course, the law freely allows customization of the more physical,\\n tangible dimensions of ownership rights. Property comes in all sorts of\\n shapes and sizes. But with respect to the legal dimensions of property, the\\n law generally insists on strict standardization.\\n Every common-law lawyer is schooled in the understanding that\\n property rights exist in a fixed number of forms. The principle is\\n acknowledged-at least by implication-in the \"catalogue of estates\" or\\n \"forms of ownership\" familiar to anyone who has survived a first-year\\n property course in an American law school.2 The principle, however, is by\\n 1. Keppell v. Bailey, 39 Eng. Rep. 1042, 1049 (Ch. 1834).\\n 2. Standard reference and instructional materials present the list of property options as being\\n closed. For example, a chapter entitled \"Introduction to Permissible Interests in Land\" in a\\n leading treatise begins as follows: \"This Treatise explores and discusses the general principles of\\n law that apply to \\'permissible interests in land,\\' which courts and legislatures have recognized.\"\\n 1 RICHARD R. POWELL, POWELL ON REAL PROPERTY § 11.01, at 11-2 (Patrick J. Rohan ed.,\\n 1999); see also CHARLES DONAHUE, JR. ET AL., CASES AND MATERIALS ON PROPERTY: AN\\n INTRODUCTION TO THE CONCEPT AND THE INSTITUTION 457 (3d ed. 1993) (\" [T]he common law\\n regarded the system of estates as closed.\"); JESSE DUKEMINIER & JAMES E. KRIER, PROPERTY\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 3\\n \\n  \\n 4\\n \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n no means limited to estates in land and future interests; it is also reflected in\\n other areas of property law, including landlord-tenant, easements and\\n servitudes, and intellectual property. Nor is the principle confined to\\n common-law countries; to the contrary, it appears to be a universal feature\\n of all modern property systems.3 In the common law, the principle that\\n property rights must conform to certain standardized forms has no name. In\\n the civil law, which recognizes the doctrine explicitly, it is called the\\n numerus clausus-the number is closed.4 We adopt this term for purposes\\n of our discussion here, which focuses primarily on the common law.\\n As befits a doctrine that has no name, the principle that property rights\\n must track a limited number of standard forms has received very little\\n examination in Anglo-American legal literature. We have discovered only\\n one full-length English-language article on the numerus clausus.5 This\\n is again in contrast to the civil law, where the doctrine is widely\\n acknowledged by commentators as being a substantive limitation on the\\n definition of property, as in Germany,\\' or a limitation on the circumstances\\n 204 (4th ed. 1998) (referring to the \"standardization of estates\"); LEWIS M. SIMES & ALLAN F.\\n SMITH, THE LAW OF FUTURE INTERESTS § 61, at 45-46 (2d ed. 1956) (presenting a short section\\n entitled \"A Doctrine of Fixed Types of Estates\").\\n 3. As one leading English comparativist has stated, \"In all \\'non-feudal\\' systems with which I\\n am familiar (whether earlier, as at Rome, or later), the pattern is (in very general terms) similar:\\n there are less than a dozen sorts of property entitlement.\" Bernard Rudden, Economic Theory v.\\n Property Law: The Numerus Clausus Problem, in OXFORD ESSAYS IN JURISPRUDENCE: THIRD\\n SERIES 239, 241 (John Eekelaar & John Bell eds., 1987). As noted infra Section I.B, depending\\n on how one does the classification, American common law recognizes more than a dozen forms of\\n property. Still, as far as we are aware, Rudden\\'s point about the number of forms being finite and\\n effectively closed in all known non-feudal property systems is accurate.\\n 4.

Certain applications of the doctrine are addressed in Merryman,\\n supra note 4, and, as we note below, the doctrine is considered in passing in a variety of sources.\\n 6. The term numerus clausus is used in Germany alongside Typenzwang and Typenfixierung\\n (both meaning \"fixation of types\" of property); the principle is considered a substantive limitation\\n on the definition of property implicit in the code. See § 854 BGB (defining property); PHILIPP\\n HECK, GRUNDRIB DES SACHENRECHTS §§ 23, 120(6) (1930). According to one treatise, for\\n example, interested parties\\n cannot be free to endow any right that they please pertaining to a thing with the\\n character of a real right. The principle of freedom of contract, which dominates the law\\n of obligations, has no validity in the law of property. Here the contrary principle holds:\\n The interested parties can only establish such rights as are permitted by the law. The\\n number of real rights is therefore necessarily a closed one.\\n 3 MOTIVE ZU DEM ENTWURFE EINES BORGERLICHEN GESETZBUCHES FOR DAS DEUTSCHE REICH\\n 3 (Berlin & Leipzig, Guttentag 1888) (authors\\' translation); Orro PALANDT, BORGERLICHES\\n GESETZBUCH 1069 (Peter Bassenge et al. eds., 59th ed. 2000); see also, e.g., KARL-HERMANN\\n CAPELLE, BORGERLICHES RECHT: SACHENRECHT 13 (1963) (\"Numerus Clausus, Typenzwang\\n oder Typenfixierung\"); KLAUS SCHREIBER, SACHENRECHT 28-29 (1993) (\"Typenzwang und\\n Typenfixierung\"); JAN  WILHELM, SACHENRECHT      146   (1993) (\"Numerus Clausus /\\n Typenzwang\"); Jurgen Kohler, The Law of Rights in Rem, in INTRODUCTION TO GERMAN LAW\\n 227, 230 (Werner F.

The principle that property forms are fixed and limited in\\n number represents an extremely important qualification to the principle of\\n freedom of contact-a principle widely regarded by law-and-economics\\n scholars as promoting the efficient allocation of resources. A willing buyer\\n and a willing seller can create an infinite variety of enforceable contracts\\n for the exchange of recognized property rights, and can describe these\\n property rights along a multitude of physical dimensions and prices. But\\n common-law courts will not enforce an agreement to create a new type of\\n property right. Remarkably, virtually no effort has been made to theorize\\n 7. The numerus clausus principle is well-established in Japanese law, although in contrast to\\n German law, Japanese law regards the principle, which is reflected in Civil Code Article 175,\\n more as a limitation on the circumstances in which property rights can be enforced against third\\n parties. MINPO, art. 175; see, e.g., YOSIYUKI NODA, INTRODUCTION TO JAPANESE LAW 198-99\\n (Anthony H.

MARK\\n RAMSEYER & MINORU NAKAZATO, JAPANESE LAW: AN ECONOMIC APPROACH 25-26 (1999)\\n (noting in passing that Article 175 limits estates in land).\\n 8. The numerus clausus is recognized as a principle of French law, and controversy centers\\n on whether it is a substantive limitation implied by Code civil Article 543 or is created through the\\n rather strict formalities required for enforcement of property rights. See generally CHRISTIAN\\n ATIAS, DROIT CIVIL: LES BIENS § 1, ¶39, at 44-45 (3d ed. 1993) (reviewing the history of\\n limitations on types of property rights in French law).

For example, in Roman law the servitude (servitus) was defined as a modification of full\\n ownership, and included usufructs (usus fructus). Servitudes were subject to limitations and a\\n presumption against creating new types.

The later breakdown of the\\n classical system included a loosening of the limitations on servitudes. ERNST LEVY, WEST\\n ROMAN VULGAR LAW: THE LAW OF PROPERTY 55-59 (1951).\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n about whether this critical qualification to freedom of contract is justifiable\\n in economic terms.\"\\n The primary candidate for an economic explanation has been the\\n suggestion that the numerus clausus is a device for minimizing the effects\\n of durable property interests on those dealing with assets in the future,\" and\\n in particular the effects of excessive fragmentation of interests, or an\\n \"anticommons.\" \" On this view, the numerus clausus serves to prevent\\n situations in which too many individuals have a veto right over the use or\\n disposition of a resource. But whatever the merits of this anti-fragmentarian\\n view for other property doctrines, it does not fully explain the numerus\\n clausus, which is aimed at limiting types of rights, not the number of\\n rightholders. As we show below, limiting fragmentation is at best an\\n incidental effect of the numerus clausus, and does not appear to be a\\n sufficiently robust explanation to account for the universal nature of the\\n doctrine and its tenacious hold on postfeudal legal systems.\"\\n When one turns to the snippets of commentary on the numerus clausus\\n found in more conventional Anglo-American legal literature, one finds that\\n the attitude is often one of hostility. Scholars and judges tend to react to\\n manifestations of the numerus clausus as if it were nothing more than\\n outmoded formalism. For example, the idea that property may exist only in\\n prescribed forms is implicitly debunked by quoting Holmes\\'s aphorism that\\n \"it is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was\\n laid down in the time of Henry IV.\"14 Taking this position one step further,\\n Critical Legal Studies (CLS) scholars have portrayed the doctrine of fixed\\n estates as perniciously reinforcing hierarchical social relations. As one\\n CLS-inspired source puts it, the \"formalistic, box-like structure\" of\\n 10. A partial exception is Rudden, supra note 3, which touches upon several possible\\n economic justifications for the doctrine, including the third-party information-cost theory we\\n develop at length in Part III of this Article. Id. at 254-56. Rudden ultimately concludes, however,\\n that the rationale for the doctrine remains a mystery. Id. at 261.\\n 11. This argument is made in its most general form in Carol M. Rose, What Government Can\\n Do for Property (and Vice Versa), in THE FUNDAMENTAL INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN\\n GOVERNMENT AND PROPERTY 209, 214-15 (Nicholas Mercuro & Warren J. Samuels eds., 1999).\\n This concern about future parties dealing in assets subject to idiosyncratic or fragmented rights\\n also animates the vaguer concerns in traditional doctrine about restraints on alienation and the\\n more recent literature reflecting anti-fragmentarian concerns. See infra Section IV.B.\\n 12. Michael A. Heller, The Boundaries of Private Property, 108 YALE L.J. 1163, 1176-78\\n (1999).\\n 13. Infra Section IV.B.\\n 14. E.g., CURTIS J. BERGER & JOAN C.

The aphorism originally appeared in Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Path of the Law,\\n 10 HARV. L. REv. 457, 469 (1897). English commentators evince similar attitudes. E.g., Susan\\n Bright, Of Estates and Interests: A Tale of Ownership and Property Rights, in LAND LAW:\\n THEMES AND PERSPECTIVES 529, 546 (Susan Bright & John Dewar eds., 1998) (stating that\\n English judges have \"bolt[ed] the door\" on existing categories of property and \"[i]t is about time\\n that the door was opened and new rights admitted on a more principled basis\").\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n 6\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n property law, that is, the numerus clausus, reflects a \"feudal vision of\\n property relationships designed to channel (force?) people into pre-set\\n social relationships.\" \"5\\n A related source of antipathy to the numerus clausus may be the\\n perception that it is a trap for the unwary. The menu of recognized property\\n forms is relatively complex, and any attempt to venture beyond simple sales\\n of goods and short-term leases into the arcane worlds of future interests,\\n easements and covenants, or intellectual property requires the advice of a\\n lawyer. When unsophisticated or poorly advised actors enter these worlds,\\n they may find that courts force the transaction into one of the established\\n \"boxes,\" with the result that the actors\\' intentions are frustrated. By\\n contrast, actors who are sophisticated or well-advised can almost always\\n manipulate the menu of options so as to realize their objectives.16 In this\\n sense, the numerus clausus discriminates in favor of those who are well-\\n endowed with legal resources and against those who are poorly endowed.\\'\"\\n A third source of the antagonism toward the numerus clausus may be\\n the lessons supposedly learned from the reform movement in landlord-\\n tenant law. This reform effort has often proceeded under the banner of\\n discarding outmoded \"property\" concepts in favor of the greater flexibility\\n and attention to the parties\\' intentions associated with \"contract\"\\n precepts.8 By extension, other features of property law that deviate from\\n the norms of free contract may fall under a cloud of suspicion. Here again,\\n standardization of forms is associated with the ancien regime, and\\n contractual norms are assumed to be more open, fair, and egalitarian.\\n 15. BERGER & WILLIAMS, supra note 14, at 211. The junior editor of this casebook, Joan\\n Williams, has been influenced by CLS theory. See generally, e.g., Joan Williams, The Rhetoric of\\n Property, 83 IoWA L. REV. 277 (1998).\\n Whatever the merits of such critiques of formalism in other contexts, they are ironic when\\n directed against the numerus clausus. Historically, the doctrine is closely associated with efforts in\\n post-revolutionary France to eliminate the proliferation of fragmented rights characteristic of\\n feudal regimes.

Waggoner, Reformulating the Structure of Estates: A Proposal for\\n Legislative Action, 85 HARV. L. REv. 729, 732 (1972).\\n 17.

ANN. 3 (1979).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 7\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n These casual criticisms of the numerus clausus fail to confront what to\\n us are the essential questions. Before condemning standardization of forms\\n and embracing a regime of contractual freedom with respect to the legal\\n dimensions of property, one must first engage in a series of inquiries: What\\n are the costs and benefits of standardization in defining property rights? To\\n what extent should standardization of rights be supplied by the government\\n rather than relying solely on owners\\' incentives to conform to the most-\\n widely used forms? If the government plays a role in standardizing rights,\\n what is the appropriate division of labor between courts and legislatures in\\n enforcing standardization and in making the inevitable changes to the menu\\n of standard forms that must occur over time?\\n In Part II of the Article, we survey the common law of property in an\\n effort to ascertain the extent to which the numerus clausus is a recognized\\n feature of that law. We find that, in practice, courts and lawyers routinely\\n abide by the principle, even if they are unaware of its existence. Perhaps\\n because it is so little discussed or recognized, however, modern American\\n courts sometimes waver when faced with a direct challenge to the numerus\\n clausus, and flirt with the notion that property forms should be subject to\\n modification by contract.\\n In Part III, we set forth a positive theory of the numerus clausus, and in\\n particular, why property rights, unlike contract rights, are restricted to a\\n limited number of standardized forms. The root of the difference, we\\n suggest, stems from the in rem nature of property rights: When property\\n rights are created, third parties must expend time and resources to\\n determine the attributes of these rights, both to avoid violating them and to\\n acquire them from present holders. The existence of unusual property rights\\n increases the cost of processing information about all property rights. Those\\n creating or transferring idiosyncratic property rights cannot always be\\n expected to take these increases in measurement costs fully into account,\\n making them a true externality. Standardization of property rights reduces\\n these measurement costs.\\n Although the numerus clausus represents a use of law to restrict\\n individual choice, in actual operation it is not inconsistent with private\\n ordering and freedom of contract. Like another network, language, the\\n system of property rights contains features that allow the creation of very\\n complex composite rights out of a limited vocabulary and rules of\\n combination. As in the case of human language, because so much can be\\n done functionally with simple building blocks, the generative power of the\\n system cannot be measured by counting the number of basic building\\n blocks allowed. Accordingly, the amount of frustration caused by\\n standardizing the building blocks is far less than would be the case if a\\n specially tailored basic building block were required for every purpose to\\n which property rights can be put.\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n 8\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n Part IV considers and rejects several potential objections to our\\n explanation. These include the claim that measurement costs can be\\n reduced just as effectively by mandating notice of idiosyncratic property\\n forms as by standardization; that parties have adequate incentives to seek to\\n conform to the most-commonly used forms without legal compulsion\\n because of network effects; that standardization can be supplied by private\\n institutions rather than by law; that the numerus clausus is a response to a\\n concern with fragmentation rather than a device for lowering information\\n costs; and that the numerus clausus has been rendered irrelevant by\\n developments in contract law.\\n In Part V, we consider how the numerus clausus functions as an\\n instrument of institutional choice. If the number of property forms is\\n \"closed,\" and cannot be expanded either by the parties\\' contract or through\\n judicial interpretation, then reforms to the system of property rights\\n generally must occur through legislation rather than through judicial\\n entrepreneurship. We argue that, because of several critical attributes of\\n legislative rulemaking, this feature also functions on balance to reduce the\\n costs to third parties of measuring the legal dimensions of property rights.\\n Thus, the institutional-choice implications of the doctrine reinforce the\\n basic information-cost rationale we identify.\\n H. THE NUMERUS CIA USUS IN THE COMMON LAW OF PROPERTY\\n To what extent does the common law of property reflect the numerus\\n clausus principle? The question does not admit of an easy answer because\\n of an odd disconnect in the law. On the one hand, courts and commentators\\n behave as if we have a property system characterized by a limited number\\n of forms not subject to contractual or judicial modification. On the other\\n hand, there is no explicit recognition of the numerus clausus, which\\n naturally renders the status of the doctrine somewhat insecure. Indeed, we\\n find some evidence of an incipient attitude that courts should simply\\n enforce the intentions of the parties and abandon any insistence that\\n property rights conform to a finite list of recognized forms.\\n A. The Numerus Clausus as a Norm of Judicial Self-Governance\\n Given basic differences between civil-law systems and common-law\\n systems, it is perhaps not surprising that the numerus clausus is expressly\\n recognized in the former but not the latter. Civil-law jurisprudence rests on\\n the premise that the code is the exclusive source of legal obligation.9 Thus,\\n 19. HENRY M. HART, JR. & ALBERT M. SACKS, THE LEGAL PROCESS: BASIC PROBLEMS IN\\n THE MAKING AND APPLICATION OF LAW 749 (William N. Eskridge, Jr. & Philip P. Frickey eds.,\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 9\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n if the code recognizes certain forms of property, but not others, it follows\\n logically that the forms enumerated in the code are the only types of\\n property that the judiciary may enforce20 The parties may not create a new\\n type of property by contract, nor may the judiciary on its own authority\\n invent new property rights, because this would contradict the code\\'s status\\n as the exclusive source of legal obligation. Thus, the only way to subtract\\n from or add to the list of legally sanctioned property forms is for the\\n legislature to amend the code.\\n The common law, of course, rejects the assumption that enacted law is\\n the exclusive source of legal obligation. Especially in private law-\\n contracts, torts, and property-common-law courts are regarded as having\\n inherent power to define basic legal principles and obligations. The\\n Blackstonian justification for this judicial authority is that common-law\\n courts enforce principles grounded in immemorial custom.2\\' The modern\\n justification is that common-law courts exercise inherent policymaking\\n authority with respect to private law,. subject to legislative revision.22\\n Whatever the justification, the common law\\'s rejection of the exclusivity\\n postulate of the civil law means that the numerus clausus cannot be derived\\n deductively from fundamental postulates about the legal system. In\\n common-law systems, there is no inherent reason why all existing forms of\\n property should derive from an act of the legislature, nor is there any\\n inherent reason why existing forms of property should not be subject to\\n judicial revision and supplementation.\\n Yet notwithstanding the absence of logical compulsion behind the\\n numerus clausus in common-law systems, it is reasonably clear that\\n common-law courts behave toward property rights very much like civil-law\\n 1994) (stating that civil-law codes are based on \"a self-contained body of statutory provisions\\n which are to be taken as the exclusive source of law, and to which all judicial decisions must be\\n referred\"); JOHN HENRY MERRYMAN, THE CIVIL LAW TRADmON: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE\\n LEGAL SYSTEMS OF WESTERN EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICA 22-23 (2d ed. 1985) (stating that the\\n separation of powers as formulated in civil-law countries precludes the doctrine of stare decisis\\n and judge-made law and that in the civil-law tradition \"only statutes enacted by the legislative\\n power could be law,\" supplemented by administrative regulations and custom); ALAN WATSON,\\n THE MAKING OF THE CIVIL LAW 168 (1981) (arguing that statutes, including foremost the code,\\n along with govemmental and ministerial decrees, are the only independent source of law, with a\\n possible subordinate source of law in custom).\\n 20. In civil-law systems, the numerus clausus is often said to be an independent substantive\\n doctrine or a principle implicit in the civil code. Supra notes 6-9 and accompanying text.

Jurisprudentially speaking,\\n the numerus clausus functions in the common law much like a canon of\\n interpretation, albeit a canon that applies to common-law decisionmaking\\n rather than statutory or constitutional interpretation,\" or like a strong\\n default rule in the interpretation of property rights.24\\n Before reviewing the evidence in support of our contention that\\n common-law courts follow the numerus clausus as a norm of self-\\n governance, it is useful to consider an example of the principle in operation.\\n Landlord-tenant law includes a version of the numerus clausus principle.\\n Leases are limited to four recognized types: the term of years, the periodic\\n tenancy, the tenancy at will, and the tenancy at sufferance.\\' Suppose a\\n landlord and tenant decide to enter into a lease that does not conform to any\\n of the four standard types-a tenancy \"for the duration of the war\" being\\n the classic example.26 If landlord-tenant law were just like the law of\\n contract, then there would be no reason not to enforce this agreement in\\n accordance with its terms; that is, the tenancy would last until the war ends.\\n But courts typically do not proceed this way. Instead, they seek to\\n determine which of the four recognized types of leases best fits what the\\n parties have created. Since a term of years requires a \"definite calendar\\n ending,\"27 and wars last for an uncertain length of time, most courts have\\n concluded that a tenancy \"for the duration of the war\" must be either a\\n periodic tenancy (if the lease provides for payment of rent at periodic\\n intervals) or a tenancy at will.28 The result of the pigeon-holing exercise in\\n 23.

The point of the discussion is to show that the number of\\n forms is fixed for most purposes, not to offer a substantive account of how\\n we came to have the particular menu of options that exist today.31 We also\\n indicate, in each area, the general attitude of the courts toward claims for\\n the recognition of novel forms of property.\\n 1. Estates in Land\\n The common-law system of estates in land is an area of property law\\n universally recognized to have a \"formalistic, box-like structure.\"\" There\\n & Storage Co., 50 A.2d 267, not by declaring that the parties are free to modify the available\\n forms of leases by contract.\\n 29. As usual, the clever conveyancer can get around the problem, here most likely by creating\\n a term of years determinable. Thus, for example, one could create a lease \"for fifty years unless\\n the war ends sooner.\" This is not exactly identical to a lease \"for the duration of the war,\" but in\\n most wars it would achieve the same result. 2 POWELL, supra note 2, § 16.03[4][b], at 16-68.\\n Commentators have predictably seized on the ability to get around the common-law rule by clever\\n conveyancing as evidence that the numerus clausus principle represents a \"triumph of form over\\n substance.\" Id.; see also 1 AMERICAN LAW OF PROPERTY, supra note 26, § 3.14, at 210. But this\\n is true only if the measurement costs to third parties of ascertaining the meaning of a lease.\"for\\n fifty years unless the war ends sooner\" are the same as the costs of ascertaining the meaning of a\\n lease \"for the duration of the war.\" As to this question, see infra text accompanying note 133.\\n 30. For overviews, see, for example, THOMAS F. BERGIN & PAUL G. HASKELL, PREFACE TO\\n ESTATES IN LAND AND FUTURE INTERESTS 19-80 (2d ed. 1984); JOHN E. CRIBBET & CORWIN W.\\n JOHNSON, PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW OF PROPERTY 40-140 (3d ed. 1989); and ROGER A.\\n CUNNINGHAM ET AL., THE LAW OF PROPERTY 26-504 (2d ed. 1993).\\n 31. If such an account were to be developed, it would show that legislation has played a\\n larger role in the creation of the forms of property than most common-law lawyers might suppose.\\n For example, the statute Quia Emptores, 1290, 18 Edw. (Eng.), which made free tenements\\n alienable, played a critical role in the development of the fee simple, and the fee tail was created\\n by the statute De Donis Conditionalibus, 1285, 13 Edw., ch. 1 (Eng.). Admittedly, however, a\\n number of forms have an uncertain provenance and probably reflect a large measure of customary\\n law. See, e.g., Richard Helmholz & Reinhard Zimmermann, Views of Trust and Treuhand: An\\n Introduction, in ITINERA FIDUCIAE: TRUST AND TREUHAND IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 27, 41-\\n 42 (Richard Helmholz & Reinhard Zimmermann eds., 1998) (noting the customary and Roman-\\n law background of trusts).\\n 32. Cf. BERGER & WILLIAMS, supra note 14, at 211 (characterizing the common-law\\n approach to landlord and tenant law).\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n are five general types of present possessory interests: the fee simple\\n absolute, the defeasible fee simple, the fee tail, the life estate, and the\\n lease.33 Some complications are always acknowledged: Defeasible fees and\\n leases can be further subdivided into subtypes,34 and the fee tail has been\\n abolished in nearly all jurisdictions and is for practical purposes defunct.\"\\n Each of these present possessory interests, except for the fee simple, has\\n one or more corresponding types of future interests: reversions, powers of\\n termination, remainders, and executory interests,36 again with subtypes.37\\n The exact number of estates in land varies somewhat, depending on how\\n the classifier treats the subtypes. But at bottom there is no disagreement\\n about the identity of the forms or their defining features.38 Moreover, for\\n purposes of everyday legal practice, the only forms that really matter are\\n the fee simple and the lease for a term of years.39 All other estates in land\\n are rarely encountered as legal interests.4\"\\n In practice, courts enforce the numerus clausus principle strictly\\n (although not of course by name) in the context of estates in land. The\\n menu of forms is regarded as complete and not subject to additions.41 To\\n take one example, testators have occasionally left property to a surviving\\n spouse as a life estate, but with the power to convey or devise a fee\\n simple.42 The intention here appears to be to create a kind of hybrid\\n between a life estate and a fee simple-a life estate if the spouse dies\\n intestate but a fee simple if the spouse decides to sell or to make a gift of\\n 33. 1 POWELL, supra note 2, § 12.01 [2], at 12-5 (enumerating the categories of freehold\\n estates and the subcategories of leases).\\n 34. The defeasible fee is usually subdivided into the fee simple determinable, the fee simple\\n subject to condition subsequent, and the fee simple subject to an executory limitation.\\n CUNNINGHAM ET AL., supra note 30, at 35-36; 1 POWELL, supra note 2, § 12.01 [2], at 12-5 &\\n n.13. Leases are usually subdivided into the term of years, the periodic lease, the tenancy at will,\\n and the tenancy at sufferance. E.g., 2 POWELL, supra note 2, §§ 16.03-.06, at 16-55 to 16-103.\\n 35. 2 POWELL, supra note 2, ¶ 196, at 14-16 to 14-18. Even before the legislative movement\\n for repeal, the fee tail was not widely used in the United States. Gregory S. Alexander, Time and\\n Property in the American Republican Legal Culture, 66 N.Y.U. L. REV. 273, 295 (1991).\\n 36. CUNNINGHAM ET AL., supra note 30, at 86.\\n 37. Remainders can be classified as indefeasibly vested, contingent, vested subject to open,\\n and vested subject to complete defeasance. Id. at 97. Executory interests can he classified as\\n shifting or springing. Id. at 107-12.\\n 38. Powers of appointment are sometimes added to the list of future interests. E.g.,\\n 3 POWELL, supra note 2, § 20.01 [2], at 20-6. But the Restatement and most commentators classify\\n powers of appointment as representing a special type of power to complete \"the terms of a\\n disposition made by a transferor.\" RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF PROPERTY § 11.1 cmt. f (1986).\\n 39. Cf. CUNNINGHAM ET AL., supra note 30, at 28 (explaining that the fee simple absolute\\n and the estate for years are the only estates that are commercially salable).\\n 40. Life estates are encountered, but nearly always today as equitable interests conveyed in\\n trust. Id.\\n 41. Indeed, the usual complaint is that there are too many recognized types of future interests,\\n and that legislation should be adopted simplifying the existing menu of options. See, e.g.,\\n Waggoner, supra note 16, at 752-56.\\n 42. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF PROPERTY: DONATIVE TRANSFERS § 12.1 cmt. b (1984);\\n I AMERICAN LAW OF PROPERTY, supra note 26, § 2.15, at 126-27.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 13\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n the property by will; No court, however, has recognized such a hybrid\\n estate. Courts are divided as to the proper characterization of such an\\n interest: Some construe it to create a life estate,43 others to create a fee\\n simple.\" But all courts recognize that the task is to squeeze the interest into\\n one of the established categories, the only question being which\\n standardized box is most consistent with the testator\\'s intentions or is\\n otherwise \"best\" in terms of policy concerns such as promoting the free\\n alienability of property. s\\n Although the menu of available estates in land is fixed from the\\n perspective of the parties and the courts, this does not mean that property in\\n land is standardized along all dimensions. The law of course permits an\\n immense amount of customization in the physical attributes of rights in\\n land, including the shape and size of the parcel and the types of\\n improvements on the land. And it is possible to cut short present possessory\\n interests or create future interests upon the occurrence of specified\\n conditions (such as a condition that a child reach the age of twenty-one or\\n that a surviving spouse remain unmarried), and these conditions are not\\n themselves limited.46 Still, with respect to the most basic legal dimensions,\\n such as duration, powers of alienation, rights of inheritance, and so forth,\\n the system of estates in land presents the picture of highly standardized\\n building blocks not subject to modification by contract or judicial decree.\\n 2. Concurrent Interests\\n The system of estates in land distinguishes forms of property based on\\n their temporal dimension. Cutting across the temporal or \"horizontal\"\\n dimension is what might be called the \"vertical\" dimension-the different\\n 43. E.g., Smith v.

Snow, 76 A.2d 877,\\n 877-78 (N.J. 1950) (per curiam). A third possibility, said to have been suggested by Holmes, is\\n that the gift over in such cases would be classified as a springing executory interest subject to a\\n power of appointment by the original grantee. HART & SACKS, supra note 19, at 590-91. This\\n ingenious solution probably more closely tracks the grantor\\'s intentions than does either the fee\\n simple or life estate construction. Note, however, that Holmes also described this solution in terms\\n of recognized interests-executory interests and powers of appointment. He did not suggest that\\n the hybrid interest simply be enforced in accordance with the grantor\\'s intentions.\\n 45. See, e.g., Bell, 31 U.S. at 74-79 (construing the interest to be a life estate because this is\\n most consistent with the intentions of the grantor); Sumner, 98 S.W.2d at 919 (construing the\\n interest to be a fee simple based on a constructional principle favoring fee simples in cases of\\n doubt).\\n 46. 1 RESTATEMENT (FIRST) OF PROPERTY § 23 cmt. d (1936) (noting a variety of conditions\\n that can be imposed as special limitations on a fee simple or life estate); id. § 24 cmt. c (noting a\\n variety of conditions that can be imposed as conditions subsequent on a fee simple or a term of\\n years); id. § 25 cmt. f (noting a variety of conditions that can be imposed as triggers of executory\\n interests); 2 id. § 157 cmt. r (providing illustrations of conditions that can be imposed as triggers\\n of vested remainders subject to complete defeasance); id. § 157 cmt. u (providing illustrations of\\n conditions that can be imposed as triggers of contingent remainders).\\n \\n 14\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n forms of concurrent interests in property among multiple parties.47\\n American law recognizes five basic categories of concurrent interests:48\\n tenancy in common; joint tenancy; marital property;-\" trusts; and\\n condominiums, cooperatives, and time-shares.\\n The numerus clausus principle is also quite strong in the concurrent-\\n interest area. There have been a number of modifications in the forms of\\n concurrent property in the last century. But these changes have almost\\n always been the product of legislative reforms, not judicial rulings, and thus\\n are consistent with a rule of judicial self-governance treating existing forms\\n as closed. Changing conceptions of women\\'s rights have given rise to a\\n number of reforms of marital property interests. For example, common-law\\n rights of dower and curtesy have been abolished in almost all\\n jurisdictions.50 Tenancies by the entirety, another form of concurrent\\n property right limited to married couples, have also been abolished in many\\n states.5\\' Usually this has been done expressly by statute, although in rare\\n instances, courts have construed legislative silence as requiring abolition\\n The tenancy in partnership-another common-law form of concurrent\\n ownership-has also been displaced in all states by the adoption of the\\n Uniform Partnership Act.53\\n In terms of creation of new concurrent interests, the most dramatic\\n development has been the emergence of condominiums and time-shares.\\n These interests reflect a combination of features of other types of property\\n interests. Individuals hold what amounts to a fee simple in separate units of\\n a complex or in a separate unit for a defined period of time and concurrent\\n interests in common areas along with other association members; relations\\n among concurrent owners are controlled by rules and regulations enforced\\n by a governing body \\' In theory, it might be possible to create a\\n 47. As a rule, the forms of property based on duration (e.g., the fee simple or the lease) can be\\n combined with the forms based on multiple ownership (e.g., tenancy in common).

Thus, one can hold a lease as a tenant in common or a possibility\\n of reverter as community property.\\n 48. 5 POWELL, supra note 2, § 40.500, at 40-3 (trust); 7 id. § 49.01, at 49-2 (nontrust\\n concurrent interests).\\n 49.

Nonpossessory Interests\\n Another general category of property rights in land consists of interests\\n that confer only limited rights of use as opposed to general possession.\\n Here, American law recognizes four basic forms: easements, real-\\n covenants, equitable servitudes, and profits.57 Easements and equitable\\n servitudes, the most commonly encountered forms, are devices for\\n permitting multiple uses of a single parcel of land or controlling\\n externalities associated with particular land uses.\\n The numerus clausus applies in a somewhat weakened form to\\n nonpossessory property rights. This area has witnessed one major judicial\\n innovation in the last 150 years: the emergence of the equitable servitude.\\n In English common law, negative easements were sharply limited in\\n number, and the burden of covenants respecting land could be enforced\\n against successors only in the landlord-tenant context.58 In response to\\n demand for a more flexible instrument that would allow the burden of\\n 55.

Bailey,0 the\\n leading English case holding that courts lack authority to transform contract\\n rights into new forms of property rights.\\n Notwithstanding this significant breach of the numerus clausus, we still\\n see significant evidence of the operation of the principle in this area. The\\n innovation wrought by the Court of Chancery was quickly limited, as\\n subsequent decisions held that equity would enforce promises as property\\n only if the promise benefits an appurtenant interest in land, only if the party\\n to be bound had notice of the promise, and only if the promise \"touches and\\n concerns\" the land.61 These limitations have -also been accepted by\\n American courts, notwithstanding persistent criticism from the academic\\n community.62\\n 4.

RESTATEMENT (FIRST) OF PROPERTY § 9 cmt. a (1936).\\n According to Blackstone, the \"antient common law\" prohibited future interests in personal\\n property,\\n because, being things transitory, and by many accidents subject to be lost, destroyed, or\\n otherwise impaired, and the exigencies of trade requiring also a frequent circulation\\n thereof, it would occasion perpetual suits and quarrels, and put a stop to the freedom of\\n commerce, if such limitations in remainder were generally tolerated and allowed.\\n 2 WILLIAM BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES *398. But Blackstone explained that the courts had\\n eventually relented, permitting bequests of personal goods and chattels for life, with a remainder\\n over to another. Id.\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n create a life estate in personal property.\" But there are few if any cases that\\n address the question of whether more exotic interests, such as defeasible\\n fees and executory interests, can be created in personal property. The reality\\n is that virtually anyone who wants to create complicated future interests in\\n personal property, including of course stocks, bonds, and shares in mutual\\n funds-the largest source of wealth in today\\'s society-does so through a\\n trust.65 The trustee holds title to the personal property in fee simple, and the\\n beneficiaries hold life estates and remainders, or sometimes more unusual\\n interests, described using the building blocks of the common-law estates in\\n land. In effect, the trust combines a highly simplified title in the underlying\\n assets with a significant degree of flexibility in designating the beneficial\\n uses of those assets.\\n In other respects as well, the available forms of personal-property\\n ownership are more limited than with respect to real property. Statutes\\n authorizing the creation of condominiums and time-shares are limited to\\n real property.66 And although the case law is rather thin, it also appears that\\n one cannot create servitudes in personal property. This, at least, is the\\n position adopted by the English Court of Chancery in the nineteenth\\n century,67 and American precedent is largely, if not quite exclusively, in\\n accord.68 In any event, servitudes on personal property are rarely\\n 64.

Intellectual Property\\n Finally, common-law systems recognize a variety of intellectual\\n property interests. The main forms here are patents, copyrights, trademarks,\\n and trade secrets. A number of jurisdictions recognize additional common-\\n law intellectual property interests, such as the right to prevent\\n misappropriation of information and the right of publicity.\\n The numerus clausus is probably at its weakest in the area of\\n intellectual property. To be sure, there is considerable stability in the\\n recognized forms of intellectual property, and federal law in the United\\n States preempts many attempts to create novel forms of intellectual\\n property as a matter of state law.70 But there are some notable exceptions in\\n which judicial creativity in fashioning new intellectual-property interests\\n has been sanctioned.\\n Most prominently, in International News Service v. Associated Press,\\'\\n the Supreme Court recognized a right to prevent the misappropriation of\\n information in news dispatches, even if the information is not copyrighted\\n and is not a trade secret.72 The Court insisted it was not creating a property\\n right in news, but simply enjoining a form of unfair competition in the form\\n of appropriating news gathered by others.73 But both Justice Brandeis in\\n dissent and Judge Learned Hand in a later decision in the Second Circuit\"\\n saw the decision as a mischievous encroachment on the principle that only\\n Congress     may    create    new    forms    of   intellectual   property-in\\n other words, the numerus clausus.

The confusion engendered by the many\\n conflicts among jurisdictions over the scope of the right has given rise to\\n calls, including a proposal by the American Bar Association, for uniform\\n federal legislation ratifying this new form of intellectual property.79\\n C. Judicial Recognition of the Numerus Clausus\\n The numerus clausus appears to function as a deeply entrenched\\n assumption of the common-law system of property rights. There are no\\n significant examples of judicial abolition of existing forms of property.\\n Moreover, courts in the modern era for the most part have declined to create\\n new ones. There are a few prominent exceptions to this latter\\n generalization, such as the judicial creation of the equitable servitude and\\n the recognition in some states of the doctrines of misappropriation of\\n information and the right of publicity. But these exceptions have been\\n confined to nonpossessory property rights and intellectual-property rights,\\n and often, as in the case of the right of publicity, there is great pressure for\\n legislative ratification of judicial innovations when they do occur. Still,\\n recognition of the concept by courts and commentators is remarkably\\n underdeveloped. At the level of doctrinal exposition, the numerus clausus is\\n almost-but not quite-invisible.\\n To the extent that there can be said to be a leading case, it is Johnson v.\\n Whiton.80 Royal Whiton devised certain land \"to my granddaughter Sarah\\n A. Whiton and her heirs on her father\\'s side.\"\\' The limitation on descent to\\n 76. E.g., Bd. of Trade v. Dow Jones & Co., 456 N.E.2d 84 (Ill. 1983); see Douglas G. Baird,\\n Common Law Intellectual Property and the Legacy of International News Service v. Associated\\n Press, 50 U. CHI. L. REV. 411, 422 (1983).\\n 77. See generally J. THOMAS MCCARTHY, THE RIGHTS OF PUBLICITY AND PRIVACY (1999)\\n (thoroughly examining the contours of the \"right of publicity\").\\n 78. The most recent tally indicates that seventeen states have recognized the right of publicity\\n by judicial decision. In five of these states, the right is now recognized by statute. In addition, ten\\n states recognize the right solely as a matter of statute rather than judicial decision. Thus, the right\\n exists in some form in twenty-seven states. 1 id., § 6.1 [B], at 6-6.\\n 79.

Of course, the issue in the case was not\\n intestate succession, that is, inheritance, but the construction of a will.\\n Nevertheless, the court construed the provision of the will as an attempt to\\n create a \"new kind of inheritance,\" that is, a new type of estate, which the\\n court said could not be done.82 Sarah was held to have taken a fee simple\\n absolute, thereby frustrating the evident intentions of Royal Whiton.\\n Johnson v. Whiton has all the makings of a leading case. The facts are\\n simple. The opinion for the court was authored by Oliver Wendell Holmes,\\n Jr., one of America\\'s most celebrated jurists and an authority on the history\\n of the common law.83 The opinion\\'s reasoning, as is typical of Holmes, is\\n tightly compressed, yet advanced with great self-assurance. It is hard,\\n however, to find signs that Johnson v. Whiton has entered into the\\n American legal consciousness (in the manner of, say, Pierson v. Posts\\').\\n The decision is not widely cited in later cases. It makes only cameo\\n appearances in the leading treatises, and then is cited for propositions other\\n than the prohibition against judicial creation of new kinds of estates.\"5\\n Perhaps a better measure of the status of the numerus clausus as a legal\\n doctrine is the way in which courts resolve disputes that arise testing the\\n 82. Id.\\n 83. Holmes also made reference to the.doctrine of fixed estates in Norcross v.

Whiton in a discussion of remainders).\\n The treatment of the decision in first-year property casebooks is especially revealing.\\n Although reproduced as a principal decision in two casebooks (both co-authored by legal\\n historians), BARLOW BURKE ET AL., FUNDAMENTALS OF PROPERTY LAW 221-23 (1999);\\n DONAHUE ET AL., supra note 2, at 457-58, Johnson v.

Most notably, neither the decision, nor the principle for which it stands, is\\n mentioned at all in most instructional materials. E.g., JON W. BRUCE & JAMES W. ELY, JR.,\\n CASES AND MATERIALS ON MODERN PROPERTY LAW (4th ed. 1999) (containing no references in\\n the index to Johnson v. Whiton or the numerus clausus idea); RICHARD H.

KURTZ & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, CASES AND\\n MATERIALS ON AMERICAN PROPERTY LAW (3d ed. 1999) (same).\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n judicial commitment to the doctrine. Here too, the evidence does not give\\n much reason to believe that American lawyers are aware of the doctrine or\\n its centrality to the system of property rights.\\n For example, one issue implicating the doctrine that has arisen in\\n several jurisdictions concerns the proper construction of an instrument that\\n purports to grant a lease of property for the life of the tenant. Under the\\n system of estates in land, there is no such thing as a \"lease for life.\" One\\n can create a life estate. And one can create a lease. But a lease must be\\n either a term of years, a periodic tenancy, a tenancy at will, or a tenancy at\\n sufferance.86 Thus, courts confronted with an instrument purporting to\\n create a \"lease for life\" have typically asked which common-law box best\\n matches the grantor\\'s intentions: a life estate or a tenancy at will.87 Yet\\n there is no evidence in these decisions that the courts are aware that they are\\n applying a foundational precept of property law, or that the assumption that\\n the interest must fit into one of the established forms reflects the same\\n general principle articulated in Johnson v. Whiton.\"5\\n A more recent New York case89 confronting the lease-for-life problem\\n suggests that courts in the future may simply defer to the parties\\' intention\\n to create a new type of leasehold. The opinion attacked the argument in\\n favor of the tenancy at will-the harsh application of the numerus\\n clausus-as being grounded in the \"antiquated notion\" that a life estate\\n cannot be created without livery of seisin.90 This outcome was also\\n condemned as \"violat[ing] the terms of the agreement and frustrat[ing] the\\n intent of the parties.\"\\'\\n As to whether the court was willing to follow the intent of the parties to\\n the point of recognizing a new type of estate-a lease for life-the decision\\n is ambiguous. Near the end of the opinion, the court characterized the\\n interest as a \"life tenancy terminable at the will of the tenant,\"\" which\\n sounds like a life estate (which can always be disclaimed by the life tenant).\\n Thus, the result that the court ultimately reached may have been to hold that\\n 86. Supra note 25 and accompanying text.\\n 87. Compare Thompson v. Baxter, 119 N.W. 797 (Minn. 1909) (life estate), with Nitschke v.\\n Doggett, 489 S.W.2d 335 (Tex. Civ. App. 1972), vacated on other grounds, 498 S.W.2d 339\\n (Tex. 1973) (tenancy at will).\\n 88. This lack of awareness is also reflected in the best-selling casebook of Jesse Dukeminier\\n and James Krier. In discussing estates in land, the authors note the doctrine of \"standardization of\\n estates\" and cite to Johnson v. Whiton. DUKEMINIER & KRIER, supra note 2, at 204-05. But when\\n they turn to landlord-tenant law, and reproduce a case that presents the \"lease for life\" problem,\\n they make no mention in the notes or the Teacher\\'s Manual of the relevance of the doctrine of\\n standardization of estates. Id. at 424-25 (notes following Garner v. Gerrish, 473 N.E.2d 223 (N.Y.\\n 1984)); JESSE DUKEMINIER & JAMES E. KRIER, TEACHER\\'S MANUAL: PROPERTY 188-90 (4th ed.\\n 1998) (summary and commentary on Garner v. Gerrish).\\n 89. Garner, 473 N.E.2d 223.\\n 90. Id. at 224.\\n 91. Id.\\n 92. Id. at 225.\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n 22\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n the instrument created a life estate, which would be consistent with the\\n numerus clausus. However, the court also noted that both parties agreed\\n that the instrument created a lease, and it, too, spoke of the interest as a\\n lease.9 This characterization, plus the court\\'s condemnation of \"antiquated\\n notion[s]\" about established forms of property and its insistence on\\n resolving the issue in terms of the parties\\' intent, could mean that the court\\n saw no problem with enforcing the instrument in accordance with its terms,\\n as a \"lease for life.\"94 Read this way, the decision could foreshadow the\\n emergence of a regime in which property rights are assimilated to contract\\n rights.95\\n D. Summary\\n In the final analysis, the idea that property interests may be created only\\n in limited numbers of standardized forms has a very odd status in the\\n common law. If one observes what lawyers and judges do, it is clear that\\n the numerus clausus exerts a powerful hold on the system of property\\n rights. At the core of the system-the system of estates in land-there has\\n been little deviation from the doctrine of fixed estates. The major departures\\n that do exist, such as the creation of the equitable servitude and the right of\\n publicity, have been relatively few in number and have been concentrated\\n in fringe areas of property rights, such as nonpossessory interests and non-\\n core intellectual property. Moreover, from the perspective of the practicing\\n lawyer, the entire system presents the picture of a fixed menu of options\\n from which deviations will not be permitted. The chances of persuading a\\n court to create a new type of property in any particular case are too remote\\n to be taken seriously. In this respect, property law has always been and\\n continues to be very different from contract law.\\n 93. Id. at 224.\\n 94. Id. at 224-25.\\n 95. Creeping \"contractualization\" of property is evident in other areas as well. See, e.g., Jezo\\n v. Jezo, 127 N.W.2d 246 (Wis. 1964) (holding that the presumption that joint tenants own equal\\n shares is subject to rebuttal by evidence of contrary intent). The new Restatement of Property\\n explicitly adopts a contractualized view of servitudes:\\n One of the basic principles underlying this Restatement is that the function of the law is\\n to ascertain and give effect to the likely intentions and legitimate expectations of the\\n parties who create servitudes, as it does with respect to other contractual\\n arrangements....\\n The general principles governing servitude interpretation stated in § 4.1 adopt the\\n model of interpretation used in contract law and displace the older interpretive model\\n used in servitudes law that emphasized the free use of land, sometimes at the expense\\n of frustrating intent.\\n RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF PROPERTY: SERviTUDES 494 (2000) (Introductory Note to Chapter 4);\\n see also id. §§ 4.1-.13, at 494-640 (setting forth an interpretive rule for servitudes based on the\\n intent of the parties and setting up default rules that can be displaced by evidence of the parties\\'\\n intent).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 23\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n If one examines the official doctrine and the reasoning of the few cases\\n that test the validity of the idea, however, the numerus clausus appears to\\n have penetrated the consciousness of common-law lawyers only weakly.\\n Perhaps the best characterization of the status of the numerus clausus in\\n American common law is that it is simply a fact about the way in which the\\n system of property rights operates. The fact is so patent and obvious, so\\n deeply entrenched, that it is rarely commented upon. But because it is so\\n rarely commented upon, common-law lawyers have little to say in its\\n defense when it is challenged.\\n III. MEASUREMENT COSTS, FRUSTRATION COSTS, AND THE\\n OPTIMAL STANDARDIZATION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS\\n What accounts for the widespread adherence to the numerus clausus,\\n not only in the common law but in postfeudal legal systems throughout the\\n world? To the extent that an explanation can be found in the American legal\\n literature, it focuses on a concern with undue restraints on alienation.96 In\\n Johnson v. Whiton, for example, Holmes stated that the conveyance to\\n Sarah \"and her heirs on her father\\'s side\" could not be construed as written\\n because this would \"put it out of the power of the owners to give a clear\\n title for generations.\"97 The restraint on alienation presumably would occur\\n because of fragmentation of property rights-the interest would create an\\n open-ended class of potential claimants to the property.98 The resulting\\n bargaining difficulties would have created large transaction-cost barriers to\\n any exchange of the property, creating an undue restraint on alienation.99\\n The problem with this argument is that the system of estates in land is\\n sufficiently flexible that one can nearly always find a way to effectuate a\\n complicated conveyance. Thus, if Royal Whiton had conveyed \"to Sarah\\n for life, remainder to her heirs on her father\\'s side,\" the conveyance would\\n 96. E.g., DONAHUE ET AL., supra note 2, at 449 (discussing the doctrine of fixed estates in a\\n section entitled \"Estates in Land and the Policy Against Undue Restraints on Alienation\");\\n DUKEMINIER & KRIER, supra note 2, at 204 (\"Once the estates system developed, judges decided\\n that standardization of estates furthered alienability by facilitating subsequent transactions in the\\n same resources.\"); SINGER, supra note 85, at 560-61 (discussing the doctrine in a section entitled\\n \"Rules Regulating Restrictions on Use or Ownership To Promote Marketability\").\\n 97. Johnson v. Whiton, 34 N.E. 542, 542 (Mass. 1893).\\n 98. The interest created by Royal Whiton was of unclear import. It might have meant that\\n Sarah had a fee simple, but if she died intestate, the property could be inherited only on her\\n father\\'s side. Alternatively, the interest might have operated something like a fee tail, descending\\n from generation to generation not to the issue of Sarah\\'s body but to the heirs on her father\\'s side.\\n Holmes seems to have assumed the latter construction. See id. (analogizing the conveyance to a\\n fee tail).\\n 99. If one construes the interest to be a modified fee tail, see supra note 98, and assumes the\\n interests of the takers in tail cannot be defeated by a conveyance of the interest by those who\\n presently hold the property, then, as Holmes noted, this would \"put it out of the power of the\\n owners to give a clear title for generations.\" Johnson, 34 N.E. at 542. The transaction costs, in\\n other words, would be enormous.\\n \\n 24\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n have accomplished the grantor\\'s apparent objectives, but in a way that did\\n not create a \"new kind of inheritance.\\' \"\\' This alternative conveyance,\\n however, would also have created a large web of potential claimants. The\\n transaction-cost barriers to exchange, and hence the practical restraint on\\n alienation, would still be large.\\'01 This suggests that the numerus clausus is\\n not in fact a very effective device for limiting undue restraints on\\n alienation.\\n The leading English case affirming what we call the numerus clausus\\n principle, Keppell v. Bailey,102 suggests a different rationale. Keppell\\n involved the conveyance of an iron works, in which the purchasers\\n covenanted on behalf of themselves and their successors and assigns to\\n acquire all limestone required by the works from a particular quarry and to\\n ship the limestone to the works on a particular railroad. The Court of\\n Chancery held that this type of agreement, although enforceable as a\\n contract between the original parties, did not fall within the recognized\\n types of servitudes enforceable against subsequent purchasers as a property\\n right running with the land. There was, however, no suggestion in the case\\n that the covenants worked an undue restraint on alienation;13 indeed, the\\n works had recently been conveyed from the original purchasers to another\\n party. Instead, Lord Chancellor Brougham stressed the more systemic\\n consequences of allowing such \"fancies,\" as they have been called,\\'0 to be\\n enforced as property rights:\\n There can be no harm to allowing the fullest latitude to men in\\n binding themselves and their representatives, that is, their assets\\n real and personal, to answer in damages for breach of their\\n obligations. This tends to no mischief, and is a reasonable liberty to\\n bestow; but great detriment would arise and much confusion of\\n rights if parties were allowed to invent new modes of holding and\\n enjoying real property, and to impress upon their lands and\\n tenements a peculiar character, which should follow them into all\\n hands, however remote. Every close, every messuage, might thus\\n be held in several fashion; and it would hardly be possible to know\\n 100. Johnson, 34 N.E. at 542.\\n 101. If we assume that the conveyance as written created a kind of fee tail in the heirs on\\n Sarah\\'s father\\'s side, see supra note 98, then the class of potential claimants would not be known\\n until the last of Sarah\\'s heirs on her father\\'s side died out. This \"indefinite failure of issue\"\\n construction would create larger transaction costs than the proposed alternative.\\n 102. 39 Eng. Rep. 1042 (Ch. 1834).\\n 103. The opinion found that the covenants were not infirm on perpetuity grounds and did not\\n constitute an impermissible restraint of trade. Id. at 1046-47.\\n 104. The Lord Chancellor said that novel forms of property cannot \"be devised and attached\\n to property at the fancy or caprice of any owner.\" Id. at 1049. Later English commentators have\\n picked up on this and have referred to idiosyncratic interests not recognized by the law as\\n \"fancies.\" Rudden, supra note 3, at 240.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 25\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n what rights the acquisition of any parcel conferred, or what\\n obligations it imposed.\\'\\n In modern terminology, the Lord Chancellor thought that permitting\\n interests like the covenants in Keppell to be established as property rights\\n would create unacceptable information costs to third parties. In this Part, we\\n develop Lord Chancellor Brougham\\'s germ of an insight by presenting a\\n theory of the numerus clausus based on optimal standardization of property\\n rights.\\'\"6\\n A. Measurement-Cost Externalities\\n When individuals encounter property rights, they face a measurement\\n problem.\"\"7 In order to avoid violating another\\'s property rights, they must\\n ascertain what those rights are. In order to acquire property rights, they\\n must measure various attributes, ranging from the physical boundaries of a\\n parcel, to use rights, to the attendant liabilities of the owner to others (such\\n as adjacent owners). Whether the objective is to avoid liability or to acquire\\n rights, an individual will measure the property rights until the marginal\\n costs of additional measurement equal the marginal benefits. When seeking\\n to avoid liability, the actor will seek to minimize the sum of the costs of\\n liability for violations of rights and the costs of avoiding those violations\\n through measurement. In the potential transfer situation, the individual will\\n measure as long as the marginal benefit in reduced error costs exceeds the\\n marginal cost of measurement.108\\n The need for standardization in property law stems from an externality\\n involving measurement costs: Parties who create new property rights will\\n not take into account the full magnitude of the measurement costs they\\n 105. Keppell, 39 Eng. Rep. at 1049.\\n 106. It is uncertain when this hostility toward the creation of new forms of property entered\\n English law. The attitude is present as early as Chudleigh\\'s Case, 1 Co. Rep. 113b, 76 Eng. Rep.\\n 261 (K.B. 1589-1595), where the judges of the King\\'s Bench construed the Statute of Uses\\n narrowly so as to make every contingent remainder a legal estate in land (and hence destructible\\n under the Rule of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders). Otherwise, said Chief Judge\\n Popham, \"no purchaser would be sure of his purchase without an Act of Parliament.\" 1 Co. Rep.\\n at 139a, 76 Eng. Rep. at 322.\\n 107. Measurement costs are a reflection of information costs, and the terms can usually be\\n used interchangeably for our purposes. Measurement reduces uncertainty and is the quantification\\n of information; measurement, being observable, makes a model easier to operationalize. Yoram\\n Barzel, Measurement Cost and the Organization of Markets, 25 J.L. & ECON. 27, 28 & n.3\\n (1982). On measurement costs in general, see, for example, id.; Roy W. Kenney & Benjamin\\n Klein, The Economics of Block Booking, 26 J.L. & EcON. 497 (1983); and Henry E. Smith,\\n Ambiguous Quality Changes from Taxes and Legal Rules, 67 U. CHI. L. REv. 647 (2000).\\n 108. For discussions of whether the buyer or the seller will incur measurement costs and\\n devices to minimize them, see, for example, Barzel, supra note 107; Victor P. Goldberg, The Gold\\n Ring Problem, 47 U. TORONTO L.J. 469 (1997); and Kenney & Klein, supra note 107, at 522-27.\\n \\n 26\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n impose on strangers to the title. An example illustrates.\"9 Suppose one\\n hundred people own watches. A is the sole owner of a watch and wants to\\n transfer some or all of the rights to use the watch to B. The law of personal\\n property allows the sale of A\\'s entire interest in the watch, or the sale of a\\n life estate in the watch, or the sale of a joint tenancy or tenancy in common\\n in the watch. But suppose A wants to create a \"time-share\" in the watch,\\n which would allow B to use the watch on Mondays but only on Mondays\\n (with A retaining for now the rights to the watch on all other days). As a\\n matter of contract law, A and B are perfectly free to enter into such an\\n idiosyncratic agreement. But A and B are not permitted by the law of\\n personal property to create a property right in the use of the watch on\\n Mondays only and to transfer this property right from A to B.\"\"\\n Why might the law restrict the freedom of A and B to create such an\\n unusual property right? Suppose, counterfactually, that such idiosyncratic\\n property rights are permitted. Word spreads that someone has sold a\\n Monday right in a watch, but not which of the one hundred owners did so.\\n If A now decides to sell his watch, he will have to explain that it does not\\n include Monday rights, and this will reduce the attractiveness of the watch\\n to potential buyers. Presumably, however, A will foresee this when he sells\\n the Monday rights, and is willing to bear the cost of that action in the form\\n of a lower sales price. But consider what will happen now when any of the\\n other ninety-nine watch owners try to sell their watches. Given the\\n awareness that someone has created a Monday-only right, anyone else\\n buying a watch must now also investigate whether any particular watch\\n does not include Monday rights. Thus, by allowing even one person to\\n create an idiosyncratic property right, the information processing costs of\\n all persons who have existing or potential interests in this type of property\\n go up. This external cost on other market participants forms the basis of our\\n explanation of the numerus clausus.\\n At this point, it is useful to distinguish three classes of individuals who\\n might be affected by the decision to create idiosyncratic property rights, or\\n fancies, as illustrated by Figure 1. First are the originating parties, who are\\n the participants to the transaction creating the fancy; this is A and B in\\n Figure 1. Second are the potential successors in interest to the asset that is\\n being subjected to the fancy. This would be anyone who might purchase\\n A\\'s reserved rights (after the transfer to B) as well as anyone who succeeds\\n to the interest acquired by B. Potential successors in interest are shown as\\n 109. A more complex hypothetical involving time shares in watches can be found in Henry\\n Hansmann & Reinier Kraakman, Unity of Property Rights 5-6 (Nov. 17, 1999) (unpublished\\n manuscript, on file with The Yale Law Journal), to which our argument about information costs\\n also applies.

One may say that these\\n classes of individuals fall within the \"zone of privity\" designated by the\\n box with the dotted line in Figure 1. Our explanation, in contrast, focuses\\n on the effect of unusual property rights on other market participants-the\\n Es, Fs, Gs, Hs, Is, and Js of the world-classes of individuals who fall\\n outside the zone of privity. As we argue, explanations based on classes of\\n individuals within the zone of privity have difficulty identifying costs that\\n are not impounded into the price facing those who make the decision\\n whether to create the fancy in the first place. An explanation based on costs\\n incurred by classes of individuals outside the zone of privity does not have\\n this difficulty.\\n 111. Thus, other market participants include those whose actual dealings with watches occur\\n by means other than consensual transactions.\\n \\n 28\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n Consider first the originating parties, A and B. Some commentators\\n have attempted to argue that the creation of novel property rights can be\\n seen as giving rise to external costs further down the road for these\\n originating parties.2 If A has sold a Monday interest in the watch to B,\\n what happens if B turns around and sells the right to D,? D, may be\\n relatively inaccessible or may be unacceptable to A for a variety of possible\\n reasons. The sale from B to D, of the Monday right may thus lower the\\n value of the retained interest in A. Alternatively, after the sale of the\\n Monday interest to B, A might sell one of the remaining days to C,, and this\\n may damage the value of B\\'s interest. To avoid these sorts of problems, it is\\n argued, the law simply presumes that A would ordinarily want to block\\n future sales by B, and so for simplicity\\'s sake just disallows the original\\n creation of a property right that could lead to such a transaction\\n altogether.13\\n Yet it is problematic to label the impact of the B-to-D, sale of the\\n Monday right an externality to A. If A can foresee the problem that B might\\n further transfer ownership of the interest in the watch, then the cost of that\\n future transaction (discounted by its probability) should figure into A\\'s\\n decision to sell the Monday interest to B in the first place. The risk of such\\n a future transaction to D, should be capitalized in the form of a lower\\n market value of A\\'s rights.\"4 Because the costs associated with this\\n contingency will be reflected in the price, there is no externality toA.\\n Thus, focusing only on the potential detriment to the two original\\n parties to the transaction-A and B-makes it hard to see that there is any\\n legitimate reason for the law to intervene and prohibit the transaction. The\\n decision to create a time-share in the watch may turn out to be an\\n improvident one. But the law generally does not second-guess mundane\\n mistakes like an improvident sale. With some reluctance, the law may stop\\n an owner from burning down her own house.\"\\' But she can presumably\\n destroy a watch she owns. And if she can destroy the watch, there would\\n seem to be no reason why A cannot diminish its value by entering into an\\n 112. Hansmann & Kraakman, supra note 109, at 5-6.\\n 113. Id. at 6. In theory, if B tries to sell to D~, A might then try to buy out D,\\'s interest. But\\n once D, has acquired the Monday right, the transfer to D, may be hard for A to undo.\\n Alternatively, A might contract in advance with B that A has a right to block such sales. But this\\n would run up against the rule against restraints on alienation.\\n 114. In this hypothetical, the possibility of the sale to D, should lower the market value of the\\n rights A retains even if for some reason it did not lower the market value of the rights hived off to\\n B.\\n 115. Eyerman v. Mercantile Trust Co., 524 S.w.2d 210 (Mo. Ct. App. 1975) (declining to\\n enforce a will provision directing destruction of a house). Interestingly, John Austin uses the\\n opposite conclusion about this situation to illustrate his conception of ownership. 3 JOHN AUSTIN,\\n LECTURES ON JURISPRUDENCE, 1861-1863, at 6 (1863) (\" If I am the absolute owner of my house,\\n I may destroy it if I will. But I must not destroy it in such a manner as would amount to an injury\\n to any of my neighbors.\").\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 29\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n improvident sharing agreement that can lead to ownership of the watch\\n being fragmented among multiple and potentially antagonistic parties.\\n For similar reasons, the costs to potential successors in interest will also\\n be mediated through the price mechanism and so will not require legal\\n intervention. In the literature on fragmentation, it is often pointed out that\\n the creation of novel interests can be difficult for later individuals dealing\\n with the asset, such as C2 and D2, to figure out or to undo. Even interests\\n that do not lead to fragmentation per se can be difficult for those in the\\n distant future to understand and take into account, and this is a reason to\\n adopt some degree of standardization in property rights.\"6 But these costs\\n are not externalities to such decisions. If a fancy lowers the price that a\\n future purchaser will pay for an interest in the watch over which A and B\\n are transacting, the difficulties facing future Ds who might purchase any\\n interest in that watch-or who might lend to the owner of the watch while\\n taking a security interest in the watch-will lead to a lower price than D,\\n might pay for an unrestricted watch.\"\\' This lower price will be reflected in\\n a lower market value the instant that the fancy creating such difficulties is\\n created. Because the difficulties to the potential successors in interest (the\\n Ds) are reflected in costs facing A (and B) now, there is no externality and\\n no need to intervene.\\n Again, limited foresight might prevent A or B from making a\\n completely accurate forecast of the costs to those who deal with the asset in\\n the future.\"\\' This does not, however, furnish a basis for taking the decision\\n 116. This argument based on the effects on potential successors in interest has been made\\n most clearly in Rose, supra note 11, at 214-15. See infra Section IV.B.\\n 117. Baird and Jackson discuss the information costs to potential creditors involved with a\\n particular asset, who would in our classification be counted as potential successors in interest.\\n Douglas Baird & Thomas Jackson, Information, Uncertainty, and the Transfer of Property, 13 J.\\n LEGAL STUD. 299, 307-09 (1984). As with the costs to successors in title, the costs to potential\\n successors in interest should be reflected in a lower price to the creating parties, thus presenting\\n no externality. But as with successors in title, systems like recording are likely to be more cost-\\n effective than the numerus clausus for the informational problems that remain. See id. at 303-07.\\n 118. The intertemporal aspect of property interests also raises the much-discussed question of\\n intergenerational equity. See, e.g., BRUCE ACKERMAN, SOCIAL JUSTICE IN THE LIBERAL STATE\\n 107-38, 168-227 (1980) (discussing justice over time); JOHN RAWLS, A THEORY OF JUSTICE 284-\\n 93 (1971) (discussing justice between generations); LEWIS M.

In such a\\n case, whether B could sell some of his interest to D, would be governed by\\n rules of contract interpretation, and property rights would arise (or not)\\n accordingly. No doubt this strictly contractarian approach would be\\n cumbersome. One would have to worry about whether D,, the potential\\n purchaser of B\\'s interest, knew whether A had contracted around the default\\n rule prohibiting such interests. Thus, some requirement of notice might be\\n necessary. But from a contractarian point of view, the problems of notice\\n and complexity of property rights can be solved through default rules. The\\n last thing one would expect would be an outright ban on types of property\\n rights.\\n There is, however, a much more straightforward problem of\\n externalities associated with the creation of idiosyncratic property rights as\\n illustrated in the watch hypothetical. These are the effects on the third class\\n of individuals identified above outside the zone of privity-the other\\n market participants. When A creates the Monday right, this can raise the\\n information costs of third parties. If the law allows A to create a Monday\\n interest, individuals wishing to buy watches or bailees asked to repair\\n watches will have to consider the possibility that any given watch is a\\n Monday-only watch (or a watch for any other proper subset of days of the\\n week) rather than a full-week watch. While A and B might be expected to\\n take into account the market-value-lowering effect of undesirable\\n idiosyncratic rights when third parties like C or D consider purchasing\\n property in this watch, they will not take into account the more general\\n effect on processing costs created by the existence of such rights when F is\\n considering a purchase of rights in E\\'s watch, or I and J are worried about\\n violating property rights.\\'\\n this regard, the numerus clausus seems like a very blunt and ineffective instrument for achieving\\n intergenerational equity. Standardizing the basic building blocks of property will probably have\\n little effect on the discount rate or on the amount of an asset left for future generations.\\n 119. For more discussion, see infra note 189 and accompanying text.\\n 120. Rose discusses some of these methods of dealing with improvident rights by recording\\n acts or through adjustment ex post.

Other informational externalities that have\\n received increasing attention in economics include the possible effect of speculation in reducing\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 31\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n A and B may have subjective reasons for creating property rights based\\n on days of the week. But, the possible existence of such rights will cause\\n information costs for others-such as E, F, G, H, I, and J-to rise. Those\\n considering whether to purchase property rights in watches will have more\\n to investigate: They will have to assure themselves that they are getting all\\n the days of the week that they want. Furthermore, they will have to worry\\n about dimensions of division and elaboration that perhaps no one has yet\\n thought of, making the acquisition of any watch more uncertain as well as\\n riskier.\\' With an indefinite set of types of rights, these costs will be higher\\n than where parties, especially unsophisticated ones, are restricted to the\\n limited menu the law allows. Furthermore, because property rights are in\\n rem, all those who might violate property rights, accidentally or not, must\\n know what they are supposed to respect.\\' An indefinite set of types of\\n rights will raise the cost of preventing violations through investigation of\\n rights.\\n To return to our hypothetical world of one-hundred watch owners,\\n suppose the value of creating the Monday-only right to A is $10, but the\\n existence of this idiosyncrasy increases processing costs by $1 for all watch\\n owners. The net benefit to A is $9, but the social cost is $90. As this\\n example suggests, idiosyncratic property rights create a common-pool\\n problem.\"\\' The marginal benefits of the idiosyncrasy are fully internalized\\n the informativeness of prices, Jeremy C. Stein, Informational Externalities and Welfare-Reducing\\n Speculation, 95 J. POL.

The informational externality we identify is not a pecuniary externality. A pecuniary\\n externality is one mediated by the price system and cannot lead to inefficiency. For example, if\\n consumers in Chicago love raspberries, this might raise the price for consumers in New York, but\\n the disutility of the New Yorkers is not a technological externality but a pecuniary one.

According to Knight\\'s well-known distinction, risk is randomness that is quantifiable in\\n terms of a probability distribution, and uncertainty is randomness that is not. FRANK H.

But in a world in which owners are free to\\n create previously unknown customized property rights, third parties would presumably face not\\n just risk but uncertainty. The uncertainty of such a regime might not be insurable.\\n 123. In Hohfeld\\'s terms, in rem rights are multital rather than paucital.

The problems of a common-pool resource were first studied by Jens Warming, Om\\n \"Grundrente\" af Fiskegrunde, 49 NATIONALOKONOMISK TIDSSKRIFr 495 (1911), translated in\\n Peder Andersen, \"On Rent of Fishing Grounds\": A Translation of Jens Warming\\'s 1911 Article,\\n with an Introduction, 15 HIST.

Overall, the creation of external\\n costs associated with this common-pool problem is likely to proceed\\n beyond the optimal level.\\'u The problem cannot be resolved by side\\n payments from the remaining ninety-nine to A, because the transaction\\n costs are virtually certain to be prohibitive. Consequently, since an\\n individual\\'s interest in creating the nonstandard right-the extra benefit\\n from using it rather than the next best alternative-is less than the\\n additional measurement costs imposed on the other market participants,\\n there is a rationale for the law to prohibit the creation of this kind of\\n idiosyncratic right.\\n One way to control the external costs of measurement to third parties is\\n through compulsory standardization of property rights.126 Standardization\\n reduces the costs of measuring the attributes of such rights.127 Limiting the\\n number of basic property forms allows a market participant or a potential\\n violator to limit his or her inquiry to whether the interest does or does not\\n have the features of the forms on the menu. Fancies not on the closed list\\n need not be considered because they will not be enforced. When it comes to\\n the basic legal dimensions of property, limiting the number of forms thus\\n makes the determination of their nature less costly. The \" good\" in question\\n here might be considered to be the prevention of error in ascertaining the\\n attributes of property rights. Standardization means less measurement is\\n required to achieve a given amount of error prevention. Alternatively, one\\n Theory of a Non-Exclusive Resource, 13 J.L. & ECON. 49, 66-67 (1970). A wider audience for the\\n analysis was gained by Garrett Hardin, The Tragedy of the Commons, 162 SCI. 1243 (1968).\\n 125. The problem here in fact may be worse than that of the prototypical common pool in\\n which one of n participants bears only 1/n of the costs of his or her actions. The choice of the\\n degree of idiosyncrasy in any given transaction may not be a continuous one. This can mean that\\n in the system of property rights, some rightholders and transactors will not be concerned with\\n small differences in idiosyncrasy and marketability at the margin.\\n 126. We consider the failure of other methods of controlling the costs of measuring basic\\n property rights in Section IV.A infra.\\n 127. This effect of standardization-however the standard is achieved-is familiar from\\n many areas, including manufacturing, see Charles P. Kindleberger, Standards as Public,\\n Collective and Private Goods, 36 KYKLos 377, 378, 384 (1983) (stating that standardization in\\n manufacturing has the twin benefits of facilitating economies of scale and of reducing transaction\\n costs by, inter alia, reducing the need for monitoring); health care information, see William M.\\n Sage, Regulating Through Information: Disclosure Laws and American Health Care, 99 COLUM.\\n L.

The tangible attributes of\\n property, such as its size, shape, color, or texture, are typically readily\\n observable and hence can be relatively easily measured by third parties. In\\n the watch example, the watch can be a Timex or a Rolex and can be any\\n size or color, and so forth. These physical attributes, and of course the\\n price, are relatively easy for third parties to process using their senses, and\\n thus there is less to be gained from standardizing them.129 The legal\\n dimensions of property are less visible and less easy to comprehend,\\n especially when they deviate from the most familiar forms such as the\\n undivided fee simple.\"\\' Thus, one would expect the effort to lower third-\\n party information costs through standardization to focus on the legal\\n dimension of ownership.\\'\\n 128. Of course, standardization of ownership forms is not the only device used by the law to\\n reduce information costs to third parties about property rights. See Carol M. Rose, Possession as\\n the Origin of Property, 52 U. CHI. L. REv. 73, 88 (1985) (noting that the standards for\\n determining possession are based on \"a specific vocabulary within a structure of symbols\\n approved and understood by a commercial people\").\\n 129. For a discussion of how the configuration of boundaries can serve to make attributes\\n harder to process and thereby deter strategic behavior, see Henry E. Smith, Semicommon Property\\n Rights and Scattering in the Open Fields, 29 J. LEGAL STUD. 131, 147-48, 161-64 (2000).\\n 130. Conditions that cut short a possessory interest or trigger the creation of a future interest,\\n see supra notes 36-37 and accompanying text, are one instance in which the law permits\\n significant variation in an attribute of property rights that is not visible. These conditions,\\n however, are nearly always expressed in \"lay language,\" describing an attribute such as age\\n (\"when she reaches twenty-one\"), marital status (\"so long as he does not remarry\"), or uses\\n (\"provided it is used for school purposes\"). It may be that such conditions are more\\n understandable to nonlegally trained market participants than are the legal dimensions of the\\n different building blocks of property themselves (e.g., fee simple, contingent remainder,\\n easement). In any event, these sorts of conditions are today almost always found in trusts, where\\n they serve as guides to the trustee in distributing the fruits of the trust among different\\n beneficiaries. Other market participants deal only with the underlying trust assets, which are held\\n by the trustee in fee simple. The widespread use of trusts, in other words, has made possible the\\n continued use of nonstandardized conditions, without at the same time imposing large\\n measurement costs on other market participants.\\n 131. It might be thought that courts and other officials (such as tax authorities) would be\\n among the third parties whose information costs need lowering. This is a consideration, but the\\n question remains why standardization in property law is different from the defaults used in\\n contract law. As for taxing authorities, the numerus clausus might ease processing, but, to a great\\n extent, tax-specific concepts of ownership may need to be devised anyway. See Noel B.\\n Cunningham & Deborah H. Schenk, Taxation Without Realization: A \"Revolutionary\" Approach\\n to Ownership, 47 TAx L. REv. 725, 727 (1992) (noting the absence of a comprehensive definition\\n of ownership under the tax code, arguing that the search for a single taxable owner is misguided,\\n and proposing to determine ownership based on financial interest just as Section 1286 of the\\n Internal Revenue Code treats a bond and its coupons as separate pieces of property).\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n B. Frustration Costs and the Language of Property Rights\\n If the only concern were in reducing third-party measurement costs,\\n then there should be only one mandatory package of property rights,\\n presumably a simple usufruct or an undivided fee simple. But\\n standardization imposes its own costs. Mandatory rules sometimes prevent\\n the parties from achieving a legitimate goal cost-effectively. Enforcing\\n standardization can therefore frustrate the parties\\' intentions.\\n Although the numerus clausus sometimes frustrates parties\\' objectives,\\n often those objectives can be realized by a more complex combination of\\n the standardized building blocks of property.32 For example, sophisticated\\n parties with good legal advice can create the equivalent of a lease \"for the\\n duration of the war\" by entering into a long-term lease determinable if the\\n war ends.3 The fact that the numerus clausus is in this sense \"avoidable\"\\n does not mean that it is trivial: Even if the standardization effected by the\\n numerus clausus principle does not absolutely bar the parties from realizing\\n their ends, this standardization comes at a price.34 The effect is roughly that\\n of price discrimination: Parties willing to pay a great deal for an objective\\n can achieve it by incurring higher planning and implementation costs. 5\\n Furthermore, the design and implementation costs imposed by the numerus\\n clausus function as a sort of \"pollution tax\" that should deter parties from\\n insisting on overusing hard-to-process property forms, thereby placing\\n higher processing burdens on market participants and especially courts.\\n The ability of the system of property rights to limit the degree of\\n frustration that comes from standardization can be grasped by comparing\\n that system to another metaphorical network: language.136 The inventory of\\n property rights can be analogized to the lexicon of a language, and the rules\\n for combining property rights are like a language\\'s grammar. In the case of\\n both property law and language, there is a potentially infinite range of\\n things one can do with the limited vocabulary and rules available.\\n 132. Supra note 100 and accompanying text.\\n 133. Supra note 29.\\n 134. In the context of corporate law, Bernard Black argues that rules that appear to be\\n mandatory can be trivial for four reasons, one of them being the rule\\'s avoidability. Bernard S.\\n Black, Is Corporate Law Trivial?: A Political and Economic Analysis, 84 Nw. U. L. REv. 542,\\n 544 (1990). However, the greater the transaction costs of contracting around a rule, the more it\\n will fall toward the mandatory end of the spectrum from weak defaults to strong defaults to\\n mandatory rules. See supra note 24.\\n 135. Furthermore, as Black notes, one should expect triviality in areas of law in which most\\n parties are sophisticated. Black, supra note 134, at 546. We argue that the numerus clausus causes\\n property law to vary in avoidability (one of Black\\'s senses of triviality) according to the\\n sophistication of the parties. Furthermore, corporate law is an area in which the participants are\\n typically concerned with liquidity, and where liquidity is a primary concern, there is an incentive\\n to conform even to nonmandatory standards. Infra notes 167-169 and accompanying text.\\n 136. Cf. ROBERT G. NATELSON, MODERN LAW OF DEEDS To REAL PROPERTY § 2.1, at 12-\\n 13 (1992) (analogizing estates in land to systems of measurement and the alphabet).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 35\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n In both language \\'and property, standardizing the building blocks will\\n cause some frustration of purposes, but the analogy to language suggests\\n why this may be tolerable. If there were only one form of tailor-made\\n property right for each objective people might have, then limiting such\\n rights would have a severe effect on the objectives people could pursue\\n with the law\\'s aid. But if building blocks can be combined in many ways to\\n serve objectives that cannot be served with the building blocks themselves,\\n then the degree of frustration depends on how well and how easily the\\n building blocks can be combined to serve those objectives. That is, it is\\n important to know the generative power of the system of property rights.\\n In this respect, the set of outputs of the property system is potentially\\n infinite for reasons analogous to those that capture the infinity of sentences\\n of a language. The set of property rights bundles is potentially infinite\\n because, like some of the rules of language, some rules for forming\\n property rights are recursive: These rules can feed into themselves.137 For\\n example, a fee simple can be physically divided and divided yet again, or a\\n lessee can create a sublease and the sublessee a (sub)sublease, etc. Also\\n leading to an infinity of outputs are rules that permit multiple owners;138 for\\n example, a fee simple can be divided into tenancies in common with any\\n number of concurrent owners or a single lease can be executed with\\n multiple lessees.39 And the rules permitting physical and temporal division\\n can be combined with the rules permitting multiple ownership. Thus, again\\n as with language, relatively simple systems can potentially have great\\n generative capacity or expressive power.\" If so, then the limitations on the\\n 137. The output of a recursive rule contains a constituent of the same category as the input to\\n the rule. Among the linguistic phenomena that call for a model including a recursive rule is the\\n complement clause beginning with \"that\": \"Pat said/believed that Chris is sick,\" \"Leslie\\n said/believed that Pat said/believed that Chris is sick,\" etc. A sentence can consist of \"that\" plus\\n another sentence (which can in turn consist of \"that\" plus another sentence, etc.). See, e.g., IvAN\\n A. SAG & THOMAS WASOW, SYNTACTIC THEORY: A FORMAL INTRODUCTION 36, 259 (1999).\\n 138. An analogous linguistic example would be the \"and on\" phenomenon. \"Some sentences\\n go on and on\" is a sentence in English, as is \"Some sentences go on and on and on,\" as is \"Some\\n sentences go on and on and on and on.\" For a good discussion of this source of infinity in syntax,\\n see id. at 27-29. This is not the same as recursion, as reflected in the flat structure of the \"and on\"\\n phenomenon; recursion, in contrast, creates a \"nested\" tree structure. The property analogy would\\n be to contrast the simple horizontal division of an interest into subinterests with the successive\\n divisions of subinterests creating more than one level.\\n 139. As argued in Section IV.B infra, the law does not intervene in any strong anti-\\n fragmentarian way here, but this is not relevant to the present point, which concerns the\\n \"expressive power\" of the property system.\\n 140. In syntax, generative capacity or power is measured by the set of outputs that a given\\n type of system can produce. E.g., JOHN E. HOPCROFr & JEFFREY D. ULLMAN, INTRODUCTION TO\\n AUTOMATA THEORY, LANGUAGES, AND COMPUTATION 217-32 (1979); BARBARA H. PARTEE ET\\n AL., MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN LINGUISTICS 451-53, 561-63 (1990). See generally THE\\n FORMAL COMPLEXITY OF NATURAL LANGUAGE (Walter J. Savitch et al. eds., 1987).

Thus, it is not necessarily correct that creating a tenancy for the duration of the war in a\\n way that satisfies the numerus clausus-a term of years determinable-conveys no more\\n information to third parties than would enforcing a tenancy \"for the duration of the war\" directly\\n as a matter of the intentions of the parties. To a sophisticated lawyer reviewing the instruments, a\\n lease for a term of, say, ten years, determinable on the end of the war, has a more certain meaning\\n than does a lease \"for the duration of the war.\" The former clearly lasts for a full ten years if the\\n war lasts that long, and it clearly terminates earlier if the war ends before the ten years are up. The\\n latter has no established meaning. Some courts have construed such an interest to be a term of\\n years, some a periodic lease, and some a tenancy at will. Supra note 28. Nor is the problem solved\\n by dropping the numerus clausus and saying that all leases will be enforced in accordance with\\n the intentions of the parties. There still may be great uncertainties about when the war ends. Does\\n it end when an armistice is declared, or when demobilization occurs, or when a peace treaty is\\n signed? These conundrums affect both alternatives, but in the case of the term of years\\n determinable, we at least know that the lease continues until the debate over when the war ends is\\n resolved. If we enforce a lease for the duration of the war according to its terms, the status of the\\n tenant while the parties debate the meaning of \"the end of the war\" is more uncertain.\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n that requires standardization by a central authority.\\'\" The grammar of a\\n language  is more   standardized, but again this generally  occurs\\n spontaneously. Standardizing property and language may not create\\n massive frustration costs because of each system\\'s generative power, but\\n the source of the standardization is different in the two networks. We return\\n to the question of the source of standards in Section IV.C.\\n C. Optimal Standardization and the Numerus Clausus\\n We are now in a position to see how the numerus clausus functions to\\n promote the optimal standardization of property rights. From a social point\\n of view, the objective should be to minimize the sum of measurement (and\\n error) costs, frustration costs, and administrative costs. In other words, what\\n we want is not maximal standardization-or no standardization-but\\n optimal standardization. Fortunately, standardization comes in degrees.\\n There is a spectrum of possible approaches to property rights, ranging from\\n total freedom of customization on the one hand to complete regimentation\\n on the other. Neither of these endpoints on the spectrum is likely to\\n minimize social costs. Extreme standardization would frustrate many of the\\n purposes to which property rights are put. On the other hand, total freedom\\n to customize rights would create large third-party measurement and error\\n costs and high administrative costs. Attention should focus on the middle\\n range of the spectrum. Starting from a position of complete regimentation,\\n permitting additional forms of property rights should reduce frustration\\n costs by more than it increases measurement and error costs to third parties\\n and administrative costs. Conversely, if one starts from a position of\\n complete customization of rights, increasing the degree of standardization\\n should lower measurement and error costs and administrative costs by more\\n than the attendant frustration costs will rise.\\n Consider a simple model of the choice of the number of property forms,\\n illustrated in Figure 2. Along the x-axis is the variable p, the number of\\n forms of property, and along the y-axis is the measure of marginal changes\\n to societal wealth.\\n \\n 144.

As the number of property forms (p) increases, error costs and\\n measurement costs also increase.45 Moreover, in this model we assume that\\n the simplest and most widely applicable property rights will be adopted\\n first; thus the fee simple is represented in the smallest set of property forms\\n (to the left on the x-axis in Figure 2). Marginal error and measurement costs\\n therefore increase with the number of forms. The curve labeled M,\\n represents the marginal costs of setting up and processing property rights.\\n As p increases, the marginal costs of measurement increase (M is positive\\n and increasing as p increases), reflecting the increased costs of\\n measurement and error associated with more-and more specialized and\\n complicated-property forms.\\'\" The number of forms may range from 0 to\\n 145. The choice bears some resemblance to the choice of the number of commons. See\\n Barry C. Field, The Evolution of Property Rights, 42 KYKLOs 319, 321-22, 328-29 (1989).\\n 146. For the more complicated property forms, marginal processing costs are higher because\\n of complexity. To the extent that these property forms are less widely applicable than ones\\n \"earlier\" on the x-axis, there are fewer instances of the property form over which to spread any\\n fixed costs in setting up and learning to process the property form.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 39\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n Q, which is defined as the number of property forms that would emerge in a\\n regime of total customization. The other curve, labeled F,, is a marginal\\n benefit curve; it represents the marginal savings in frustration costs from\\n changes in p. As p increases, the marginal frustration costs saved decrease\\n (F, is positive and decreasing as p increases), because as we move from the\\n fee simple to more specialized forms, the addition of each form saves less\\n in frustration costs. Thus, movements toward more forms of property yield\\n (increasingly smaller) benefits in terms of reduced frustration costs from\\n efforts to achieve goals that the menu of property forms does not directly\\n allow.\\n The numerus clausus principle can be seen from this perspective as a\\n device that moves the system of property rights in the direction of the\\n optimal level of standardization, that is, p *.147 By creating a strong\\n presumption against judicial recognition of new forms of property rights,\\n the numerus clausus imposes a brake on efforts by parties to proliferate new\\n forms of property rights. On the other hand, by grandfathering in existing\\n forms of property, and permitting legislative creation of new forms, the\\n numerus clausus permits some positive level of diversification in the\\n recognized forms of property. We do not argue that any particular number\\n of property forms is in fact optimal. Nor do we argue that the forms\\n currently recognized by the common law are ideal and beyond\\n improvement. We do submit, however, that the numerus clausus strikes a\\n rough balance between the extremes of complete regimentation and\\n complete freedom of customization, and thus leads to a system of property\\n rights that is closer to being optimal than that which would be produced by\\n either of the extreme positions.\\n D. Information Costs and the Dynamics of Property\\n Finally, our explanation of the numerus clausus generates some general\\n predictions about the way in which property regimes will change over time:\\n As the costs of standardization to the parties and the government shift, we\\n expect the optimal degree of standardization to rise or fall. Consider the rise\\n of registers of interests in real property, that is, recording acts. This device\\n lowers the costs of notice; it is an alternative method of lowering\\n information costs.148\\n 147. Rudden acknowledges the possible role of standardization in reducing information costs,\\n but he does not draw out its implications. He concludes that there is no economic justification for\\n the numerus clausus, and in particular, he thinks that the possibility of contracting for\\n idiosyncratic rights makes standardization through the numerus clausus irrelevant. Rudden, supra\\n note 3, at 253-54. That is, he appears to assume the correctness of the irrelevance objection, which\\n we criticize in Section IV.C infra.\\n 148.

Similarly, in the case of\\n security interests, the provision of notice through filing allowed the\\n loosening of the earlier quite strict limits on the types of security interests\\n permitted.\"\\n Likewise, the more recent move toward increased use of contract\\n principles in areas like electronic commerce fits in well with the\\n information-cost theory of the numerus clausus. Notice is arguably easier to\\n furnish (if not to process) when, for example, rights to digital content are\\n being transferred, and notice of restrictions and other features of rights\\n transferred are technologically not difficult to provide.\"\\' Also fitting this\\n pattern are recent criticisms of negotiability as being superseded by\\n technology.\"\\'5 Negotiability imposes very strict formality requirements\\n precisely in order to reduce the need to measure the reliability of an\\n instrument. But when technology furnishes alternative means of promoting\\n reliance (including lowering the need to measure risk), there is less need for\\n the standardization provided for by the requirements of negotiability. In\\n general, to the extent that technological change allows cheaper notice of\\n relevant interests, the need for standardization by the law will be somewhat\\n diminished. Just as the rise of land registers allowed some loosening of the\\n numerus clausus, so too technology that lowers information costs can be\\n expected to weaken the numerus clausus further.\\n IV. POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS\\n We anticipate a variety of objections to our optimal standardization\\n theory of the numerus clausus, which we collect under three headings. The\\n first we call \"libertarian\" objections, because they share the common\\n theme that government-mandated standardization is not necessary in order\\n to reduce third-party measurement costs. The second we call the\\n \" antifragmentation\" objection, because it posits that the numerus clausus is\\n designed not to reduce third-party information costs but rather to restrict the\\n fragmentation of ownership. The third we call the \"irrelevance\" objection;\\n basically, it posits that virtually anything one can do with property can also\\n 149.

We argue that none of these various arguments is\\n ultimately persuasive.\\n A. Libertarian Objections\\n The argument that government-mandated standardization of property\\n forms, that is, the numerus clausus, is not necessary comes in three forms.\\n The first posits that the government need not standardize because third-\\n party informational needs can be supplied just as effectively by requiring\\n notice of idiosyncratic property forms. The second, which draws upon the\\n burgeoning literature on network effects, argues that government-mandated\\n standardization is unnecessary because standardization would occur without\\n government guidance. The third is that standardization can be supplied by\\n private organizations and associations rather than the government. We\\n address in turn each of these variations on the libertarian theme.\\n 1. Notice Cures All\\n An emphasis on freedom of contract is characteristic of a critique of\\n certain manifestations of the numerus clausus offered by libertarians. Not\\n surprisingly, libertarians see the standardization of property rights as\\n standing in the way of parties\\' exercise of contractual freedom. The\\n libertarian argument has been made most forcefully by Richard Epstein in\\n his call to abolish the existing restrictions on servitudes.\\'\" In his view, legal\\n intervention is needed only to provide notice by recordation of privately\\n created interests. As long as such interests are recorded, they may take any\\n form the parties choose.\\n For Epstein, the function of recordation is to identify to prospective\\n purchasers the individual with whom one has to deal in order to acquire\\n title.53 Because land is permanent and immobile, recording can give notice\\n to prospective purchasers not just of the physical dimensions of land but\\n also of the legal dimensions, such as complex forms of servitudes and\\n future interests.54 While prospective purchasers must search for such\\n information, the search is channeled into the records and the result is more\\n 152. Richard A. Epstein, Notice and Freedom of Contract in the Law of Servitudes, 55 S.\\n CAL. L. REV. 1353 (1982) [hereinafter Epstein, Servitudes]; see also Alfred F. Conard, Easement\\n Novelties, 30 CAL. L. REv. 125, 131-33 (1942) (arguing that the enforcement of easements should\\n not be objectionable on grounds of novelty as long as there is notice). Epstein has also advanced a\\n version of the argument in urging abolition of restrictions on the creation of future interests, such\\n as the Rule Against Perpetuities. Richard A. Epstein, Past and Future: The Temporal Dimension\\n in the Law of Property, 64 WASH. U. L.Q. 667, 705-07 (1986).\\n 153. Epstein, Servitudes, supra note 152, at 1355.\\n 154. Id.\\n \\n 43\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n certain than was true under the common-law rules that the recording system\\n displaced. Moreover, Epstein recognizes the crucial point that the costs of\\n creating novel property rights will be capitalized into the present market\\n value of the property.\\'5 If A creates undesirable restrictions or interests that\\n will be difficult to remove, then the market value of A\\'s property drops\\n today by the discounted amount that future buyers would spend to remove\\n these items or would demand to be paid to live with them. Thus, the costs to\\n future purchasers of the right are internalized to the right\\'s creator.\\n Aside from requiring notice, Epstein argues, the only role of courts, just\\n as in contract law, is to interpret the parties\\' intent and to supply default\\n terms when evidence of intent is lacking.156 The whole point of property\\n law, he argues, is to establish a sphere in which individuals\\' choices are\\n respected (and facilitated through enforcement) rather than overruled by\\n collective preferences.m\\' As long as actors do not infringe upon the rights\\n of third parties, there is no principled basis for disrespecting choices in\\n servitude law any more than in property or contract law more generally.\\n What this critique overlooks is that the adoption of idiosyncratic\\n property rights has an impact not only on the originating parties and\\n potential successors in interest, but also on other market participants.\\n Idiosyncratic rights create a common-pool problem, which does impose\\n external costs on third parties. Making the running of a fancy depend solely\\n on the original parties\\' intent and on notice-even recorded notice-to\\n subsequent parties acquiring property assumes that notice is the most cost-\\n effective method to minimize third-party information costs. But notice of\\n idiosyncratic property rights is costly to process, and, although land\\n registers furnish notice at far lower cost than would a doctrine of\\n constructive notice, even they can require lengthy and error-prone\\n searches.\"\\'\\n A comparison with the costs of processing contracts highlights the\\n processing problem. Even the terms of a bilateral contract are not costless\\n to process. This is one reason why parties may leave clauses in a contract\\n simple: A simple clause requires less inspection for hidden traps (or\\n investments by the writer of the clauses in precommitting not to write in\\n 155. Id. at 1360.\\n 156. Id. at 1357.\\n 157. Id. at 1358.\\n 158. The nineteenth-century English commentators cited supra note 148 were aware of this\\n point. That processing costs can be higher or lower depending on how notice is presented emerges\\n also from the few studies on the relative costs of recording versus Torrens systems. See Joseph T.\\n Janczyk, An Economic Analysis of the Land Title Systems for Transferring Real Property, 6 J.\\n LEGAL STUD. 213 (1977); see also Joseph T. Janczyk, Land Title Systems, Scale of Operations,\\n and Operating and Conversion Costs, 8 J. LEGAL STUD. 569 (1979); cf. Baird & Jackson, supra\\n note 117, at 308 & n.25 (noting that filing comes closer to conclusively establishing title under the\\n Torrens system than under other systems).\\n \\n 44\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n traps).\\'59 These processing costs are all the higher in the more impersonal\\n context of land registers, and especially where transactors do not deal with\\n all the market participants. The very existence of idiosyncratic, hard-to-\\n process property rights makes information about property rights in general\\n harder to process. Third parties incur heavier measurement costs in\\n processing \"notice\" when the universe of property rights includes\\n idiosyncratic servitudes or other \" fancies\" than when these are prohibited.\\n Moreover, these costs are true externalities of any given transaction. The\\n costs to third parties who do not deal even indirectly with the creator of the\\n unusual servitude are not capitalized into the price of the creator\\'s property,\\n and hence the creator cannot be expected to take these costs into account.60\\n In particular, the higher measurement costs for parties considering other\\n parcels are not reflected in a lower price for the parcel of the creator of such\\n rights.\\n Of course, if parties had complete freedom to customize property\\n rights, they would undoubtedly find it advantageous to conform somewhat\\n to market-generated coordination points. Nevertheless, because not all costs\\n of nonstandard rights would be internalized to them, we would expect to\\n find some individuals exercising their freedom in a way that would lead to a\\n suboptimal level of standardization.\\'\\'\\n 2. Standardization and Network Effects\\n A second possible reason why mandatory standardization may be\\n unnecessary is that standardization will occur spontaneously. The argument\\n might draw upon the growing literature on \"network effects\" or \"network\\n externalities.\" Although somewhat difficult to define, network effects arise\\n when a consumer\\'s value of a good depends on the number of other users;\\n the interdependence of consumer valuations leads to a network that is literal\\n (as in the case of the telephone system) or metaphorical (as in the case of\\n language).62 Consumers benefit from the larger network made possible by\\n the participation of others or, equivalently, suffer a cost from others\\'\\n 159. Eric Rasmusen, A Model of Negotiation, Not Bargaining 1-2, 8-21 (May 1, 1998)\\n (unpublished manuscript, on file with The Yale Law Journal).\\n 160. This of course includes parties who are not prospective purchasers but who may incur\\n losses due to a violation of the terms of the servitude.\\n 161. In contexts in which marketability is a primary concern for transactors, we would expect\\n the desire to conform to standards to be at its greatest. Infra note 167 and accompanying text.\\n 162. Furthermore, the decision whether to consume a good may have a positive or negative\\n network effect: It is positive if the choice to consume increases the value of that type of good to\\n other consumers (for example, by the ability to communicate or interact at low cost), and it is\\n negative if it reduces the value to others (for example, through overcrowding). E.g., Joseph Farrell\\n & Garth Saloner, Standardization, Compatibility, and Innovation, 16 RAND J. ECON. 70, 70-71\\n (1985); Michael L. Katz & Carl Shapiro, Network Externalities, Competition, and Compatibility,\\n 75 Am. ECON.

Particularly where transactors are trying to enhance the\\n marketability of the property they create, there will be a strong desire to\\n conform to emerging standards.\\'67 Thus, it may be argued, there is no need\\n for the government to impose limits on the available menu of property\\n forms; those packaging property would select standardized forms anyway,\\n because of the benefits of participating in a network. Government\\n 163. Where there are network effects, the increasing returns to scale stem from demand-side\\n factors-consumers derive more value from a larger network-rather than from the familiar\\n increasing returns that stem from decreases in average costs of production (on the supply side)\\n over a stated period of time.

Liebowitz and Margolis argue for distinguishing\\n \"network effects\" from \"network externalities\" on the basis of whether suboptimal conditions\\n result: Network effects obtain in markets in which there are increasing returns to scale, and\\n network externalities exist only where increasing returns lead to suboptimality.

For a discussion of the difficulties with defining externality in terms of a cost\\n not mediated by the price mechanism, see PAPANDREOU, supra note 121, at 49-54. The question\\n relevant to the design of legal institutions is whether the cost that might be termed an externality is\\n remediable by legal rules or not, according to one\\'s chosen criteria for justifying legal\\n intervention.\\n 165.

REv. 133, 134 (1989)\\n (discussing the benefits of retaining standard contract forms).\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n intervention to assure standardization of forms at best is redundant, and at\\n worst interferes with the evolution of the optimal number and type of\\n forms.\\n This argument misses the point about the nature of the problem that the\\n numerus    clausus   is  designed   to   overcome.    Government-imposed\\n standardization here is not designed to assure that large numbers of owners\\n participate in a network and, hence, provide external benefits for other\\n participants. Rather, standardization is imposed to control a negative\\n externality created by the prospect that a few persons will deviate from\\n popular forms. Thus, the numerus clausus is aimed at what might be called\\n a special kind of network confusion effect based on problems of processing\\n information, rather than on the size of the network of participants.\\n One can have a powerful network effect pushing nearly all participants\\n toward standard forms and still suffer from a network confusion effect that\\n raises the information-processing costs to all the participants in the\\n network. The one out of one hundred who adopts a nonstandard form for\\n property rights can increase the costs of processing the rights of ninety-nine\\n others. It is not just that the ninety-nine do not benefit from one more\\n addition to their \"network\" of standardized property rights. Rather, it is\\n that the ninety-nine are worse off because of the possibility of the one-\\n hundredth idiosyncratic right than they would be if that right could not be\\n created at all. This is not a matter of increasing the value of rights with\\n more users, but of preventing confusion to users who already exist.\\n We readily concede that property owners for whom marketability is\\n critical at the margin will standardize without government intervention.\\n Where actors are very interested in liquidity, economists predict a high (if\\n not excessive) degree of standardization.168 It is this sort of situation on\\n which recent commentators have focused their attention and which fits most\\n comfortably within the conventional view of networks. Thus, a public\\n corporation designing securities to be traded on the market will respond to\\n the network benefits of standardization and will opt for standards without\\n being forced to do so. In such cases, the numerus clausus, to the extent it\\n plays a role, serves to identify coordination points and to start a\\n convention.169\\n 168. For example, securities\\' prices will be discounted to reflect the cost of acquiring\\n additional information if the security includes uncertain features. See, e.g., ALLEN & GALE, supra\\n note 127, at 123, 311-13 (discussing and citing literature). For a skeptical treatment of arguments\\n that network effects lead to an inefficient lock-in to standards, see supra note 166.\\n 169. Thus, in corporate law, there seems to be a role for government standardization to\\n provide forms, just as the government prescribes which side of the road to drive on. But once the\\n coordination point attains salience through government fiat, almost everyone is happy to abide by\\n the regularity. See, e.g., DAvtD K. LEWIS, CONVENTION: A PHILOSOPHICAL STUDY 78-79 (1969)\\n (defining \"convention\"); H. Peyton Young, The Economics of Convention, J. ECON. PERSP.,\\n Spring 1996, at 105, 105-06 (same). This role in establishing coordination points is consistent\\n with what Black terms triviality in corporate law. Black, supra note 134, at 544 (discussing\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 47\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n In other circumstances, however, there is an implicit recognition that\\n the private benefits of doing the conventional thing do not always control\\n individual decisionmaking. For example, there will be situations involving\\n families and small enterprises in which idiosyncrasies in property rights\\n may be valued more than the fraction of common-pool increase in\\n information costs. For a given owner, the desire to accomplish a certain\\n goal (for example, keeping property within a close-knit group) can\\n outweigh concerns for future marketability. It is in these sorts of\\n circumstances that the numerus clausus does play a role.\\n The distinction we have drawn between ordinary network externalities\\n and network confusion effects carries over into other networks besides\\n property rights. Consider weights, measures, and money. A company that\\n begins using kilograms as a unit of measurement may lose the advantage of\\n network effects in the U.S. market, where most participants adopt English\\n units of measurement. But a company that begins using a nonstandard\\n weight called a \"pound,\" but actually equal to 1.2 pounds, will produce far\\n more measurement costs for third parties; adoption of the purely\\n idiosyncratic unit of measurement will generate confusion. Money works\\n similarly, and it is noteworthy that defacing currency is sometimes a crime\\n while destroying it altogether is not:10 Defacing currency causes\\n measurement costs to rise, but destroying it does not.\\n The analogy to language, discussed above in Section III.B, also sheds\\n some light on the question of when standardization needs to be provided\\n centrally. Because of standard network effects, government intervention is\\n not required to give language a high degree of standardization: People want\\n to make themselves understood.\\'7\\' Relatedly, language in most everyday\\n contexts is treated as a flexible (as opposed to a fixed) standard: Newly\\n coined words can be freely tolerated in order to express new meanings.172 in\\n this respect, the numerus clausus is closer to a fixed standard like weights\\n and measures, where individual innovation is too costly to tolerate. Even in\\n market-mimicking rules). In the numerus clausus, we argue, there is a greater need to police the\\n standard.\\n 170. This is the case in England and Wales. Bernard Rudden, Things as Things and Things as\\n Wealth, in PROPERTY PROBLEMS: FROM GENES TO PENSION FUNDS 146, 155 n.14 (J.W. Harris\\n ed., 1997). Similarly, it is illegal to deface currency in the United States. 18 U.S.C. § 333 (1994)\\n (\" Whoever mutilates, cuts, defaces, disfigures, or perforates, or unites or cements together or does\\n any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt . .. with intent to render\\n such bank bill, draft, note or other evidence of debt unfit to be reissued, shall be fined under this\\n title or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\")\\n 171.

Privately Supplied Standardization\\n A third objection to government standardization is that the problem of\\n third-party measurement costs can be handled by private entities. The\\n provision of standards may seem like a public good, but this does not mean\\n that it must be supplied by the government. If private parties can\\n appropriate the benefit of the standards, they can be supplied privately. For\\n example, brand names or warranties might be used to vouch for the legal\\n dimensions of property rights, or private certification systems might arise to\\n assure parties that property rights conform to certain standards.74\\n 173.

On oil tankers, see 33 U.S.C. § 1228(a)(7) (1994), which states,\\n \"No vessel ... shall operate in the navigable waters of the United States..., if such\\n vessel . . . while underway, does not have at least one licensed deck officer on the navigation\\n bridge who is capable of clearly understanding English.\"; and compare United States v.

Moreover, if one set of basic building\\n blocks will do for most purposes, government provision of such a system is\\n likely to be characterized by significant economies of scale and scope.182\\n Setting up the system of property rights involves proportionately large fixed\\n costs compared to the marginal administrative cost of extending the rights\\'\\n application to more individuals, making jurisdiction-wide application\\n attractive. The state as the enforcer of property rights also probably enjoys\\n an advantage in delineating the basic forms of property rights: From the\\n point of view of the supplier, enforcing and defining basic forms of\\n property rights are likely to be complementary activities.\\n Finally, indirect empirical evidence points to the superiority of the\\n numerus clausus as a standardization device. Throughout history and across\\n numerous legal systems, the provision of standards for the basic building\\n blocks of the property system has been largely a government affair. The\\n fact that the numerus clausus is so widespread and enduring, is so pervasive\\n within each system, and is otherwise quite puzzling from a contractarian\\n point of view, suggests that it has inherent advantages for solving the\\n standardization problem that are not easily replicated by private ordering.\\n B.

In terms of Figures 2 and 3, the number of forms (p) probably correlates with how likely\\n private provision of forms will be.

Sterk, Freedom\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 51\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n elaborated by Michael Heller, who has coined the term \"anticommons\" to\\n describe the potential problem.1 The basic point is that if ownership of\\n resources becomes excessively fragmented, it will become difficult or\\n impossible to reach the unanimous consent among all stakeholders\\n necessary to put the property to productive uses. We have already noted\\n that Holmes, in Johnson v. Whiton, appeared to view the numerus clausus\\n as a doctrine designed to prevent undue restraints on alienation-a theory\\n that implicitly rests on concern about fragmentation.185 Heller has also\\n recently cited the numerus clausus as an example of a property principle\\n that works to minimize fragmentation, thus making the antifragmentation\\n argument explicit.\\'16\\n Viewed as an antifragmentation regime, however, the numerus clausus\\n has a very curious quality; namely, it prohibits some kinds of fragmentation\\n but is highly tolerant of others. Parties are allowed even in the area of\\n personal property to fragment their interests: With respect to a watch, one\\n can have an unlimited number of co-owners with present possessory\\n interests (whether or not exercised).\\'7 Thus, when it comes to division of\\n the watch among co-owners, the law does not prevent an anticommons but\\n rather leaves it up to parties to choose the degree of fragmentation they\\n wish, and to bear the costs of any mistakes they might make. Even more\\n fragmentation    is  allowed    in   real  property.   Indeed,   from    an\\n antifragmentation or anticommons point of view, the size of parcels or the\\n number of co-owners generate the most pressing problems, and yet the law\\n does not directly limit this type of fragmentation. Instead, it places a limit\\n on the number of types of interests rather than on the number of interest\\n holders.\\n Not only does the numerus clausus tolerate much fragmentation, the\\n principle\\'s operation does not necessarily lead to less fragmentation. For\\n example, the law construes a \"lease for life\" to be either a life estate or a\\n tenancy at will.\\'8 But neither outcome reduces the number of holders.\\n Many applications of the numerus clausus do not result in fewer\\n rightholders, making the doctrine difficult to view as an antifragmentation\\n device.\\n from Freedom of Contract: The Enduring Value of Servitude Restrictions, 70 IOwA L.

Even if\\n a public remedy for \"excessive\" fragmentation of property rights (caused\\n by, say, individuals\\' limited foresight) were not worse than the disease,89\\n the action for partition, adverse possession, the Rule Against Perpetuities,\\n recording acts, doctrines of changed conditions, the government\\'s power of\\n eminent domain, and the like appear to be much more direct and cost-\\n effective methods of preventing excess fragmentation of property rights.19\"\\n Compared to these devices, the numerus clausus does relatively little to\\n limit excessive fragmentation.\\n Simply pointing out that a rule has the effect of limiting fragmentation\\n to some degree is not enough to provide a persuasive explanation for its\\n existence. A doctrine that aims at standardizing property rights rules out\\n many kinds of rights, and some of these are characterized by fragmentation,\\n in the sense of divided ownership. But the anticommons or anti-\\n fragmentarian view cannot explain why the law leaves the fragmentation\\n decision to parties in many cases, uses mild devices to limit interests in\\n others, and imposes strong standardization in yet other cases.\\n Our focus on the information costs incurred by other market\\n participants is distinct from the concern with excessive fragmentation of\\n property rights, and, we believe, provides a better explanation for the\\n persistence of standardization of property forms. Viewing the numerus\\n clausus as a standardization device allows us to explain why it mandates a\\n limited number of legal forms, which are harder to process than physical\\n 189. Cognitive biases lead to errors that are sometimes said to be inconsistent with\\n rationality; controversy has centered on whether the cognitive biases claimed in behavioral\\n decision theory (BDT) really do violate probability theory and whether the heuristics that lead to\\n cognitive biases are explanatory.

The Irrelevance Objection\\n A final potential objection to our theory is that although the numerus\\n clausus is a feature of traditional forms of property such as estates in land,\\n it is for practical purposes irrelevant in the modern world, given the\\n emergence of new forms of organizational ownership based on contract.192\\n Contract, the objection would run, has in effect superseded property.\\n Contract rights are now generally freely assignable, giving such rights the\\n kind of transferability traditionally associated with property. Moreover,\\n most resources today are controlled by legal entities organized around a\\n nexus of contracts, such as trusts, partnerships, and corporations. Using\\n contracts, contract assignments, and these organizational forms, individuals\\n can hold resources in any form they wish, rendering the traditional boxes of\\n property a quaint anachronism.\\n We do not dispute the importance of assignable contracts and of\\n organizational forms of ownership, and we readily concede that these\\n developments have greatly enhanced the flexibility with which resources\\n can be deployed.193 But as we see it, these developments do not supersede\\n the standardization associated with basic property forms, nor do they render\\n the numerus clausus irrelevant. Rather, modern organizational forms build\\n up from and are dependent on the foundation established by the numerus\\n clausus.\\n First, consider assignable contracts. Contract rights today can generally\\n be assigned, subject to limitations that protect the original parties.194 And in\\n many transactional settings, complex assignment clauses might be an\\n acceptable substitute for property rights. With respect to servitudes, for\\n example, if a real estate developer wants to assure that all houses in a\\n subdivision are painted beige, one can imagine doing this either with real\\n covenants incorporated into the deeds (the property solution), or by\\n executing contracts with the original purchasers that mandate that the\\n contract be assigned to all subsequent purchasers (and that all assignments\\n contain mandatory assignment clauses, in infinite regress). But property\\n 191. Supra note 130 and accompanying text.\\n 192. Rudden, supra note 3, at 253-54, appears to subscribe to this objection. Supra note 147.\\n 193.

One can perhaps use contracts to bind successors in interest to\\n paint a house beige, but it is not practical to use contracts to bind the whole\\n world not to commit trespasses or nuisances on the property.19\\' In rem\\n rights provide protection against in personam harms, but it is not practical\\n to create an in rem right by bundling together myriad in personam rights\\n that have been individually negotiated with every potential wrongdoer.9\\'\\n Thus, in many contexts transaction costs will prevent contracts from\\n serving as an effective substitute for property rights.\\n Moreover, contract assignment builds on the most basic standardized\\n unit of ownership established by property law. By and large, only one type\\n of assignment is permitted: The assignee steps into the shoes of the\\n assignor.I\\'\" In effect, only \"full ownership\" of the right can be assigned if\\n the assignment is to be treated as resulting in an enforceable interest in the\\n assignee.\\' Complex estates in contract rights-such as future interests-\\n do not seem to exist. As between the parties themselves, little is frustrated\\n by   limiting  assignments    to  a   fee  simple-like   estate; by    contrast,\\n standardizing the contract rights themselves might lower information costs\\n a little but would entail high frustration costs. The parties can usually serve\\n their objectives by tailoring the contract itself, or entering into a new\\n contract. But for others processing both the original contract rights and the\\n higher-order rights (rights over rights, etc.), it is helpful to know that only\\n the terms of the agreement need to be processed and that another layer of\\n such complexity can be safely ignored.

Recall that, when we\\n modeled the number of property forms as a tradeoff between definition\\n costs and savings in frustration costs, we noted that property systems start\\n with the simplest and most-widely used forms and add more complex and\\n specialized forms as the number of allowed forms increases. Now consider\\n contractual forms. Here too we can arrange the forms along a spectrum\\n from most to least-widely used, but here, limiting the forms is likely to lead\\n to greater marginal frustration costs than in the case of property forms.\\'\"\\n This can be illustrated as in Figure 4. (We assume for expositional\\n simplicity that the marginal costs of measuring property rights, M,, equals\\n the marginal costs of measuring contract rights, M; this assumption is\\n unlikely to change the analysis because, if anything, M, is likely to be\\n lower.)\\n FIGURE 4.

Our claim is that a hypothetical numerus clausus-like limited set of ways of contracting\\n (making enforceable agreements) would be unlikely to function like the building blocks of\\n property in being easy to combine and so accomplish a wide range of objectives. That is,\\n standardizing the dimensions along which contracts can vary would have an effect like\\n standardizing the dimensions of property-such as physical dimensions and legal conditions-\\n that are currently not standardized. See supra note 46.\\n \\n 56\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n Because the addition of allowable contract forms saves more in\\n frustration costs than does the addition of more property forms, the FC curve\\n lies above the F, curve, with the result that the optimal number of allowed\\n contract forms is greater than the optimal number of property forms. That\\n is, contract should be (and is) less standardized than is property law.\\n Organizational forms like trusts are also dependent on the building\\n blocks of the common law. Legal title to trust property is typically held in\\n fee simple, while the equitable interests of the beneficiaries are described in\\n terms of the common-law estates in land20 This permits resources to be\\n managed for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries with far lower third-\\n party information costs than would otherwise be the case. The corpus of the\\n trust can be bought and sold, invested and reinvested, leased and\\n mortgaged, in the sound discretion of the trustee as if the property were an\\n undivided fee simple. The complexities of dividing the fruits of these\\n efforts among different generations and classes need not trouble the third\\n parties who deal with the trustee in the management of the trust corpus.\\n Dividing the fruits is a concern only of the settlor, the trustee, and the\\n beneficiaries. And to the extent that courts, creditors, and others must\\n measure the different beneficial interests, the fact that they are described in\\n the vocabulary of common-law estates in land reduces the information costs\\n associated with this exercise.\\n We also suspect, although the point takes us beyond the scope of this\\n Article, that a close look at various contractual and contract-based solutions\\n to the control of resources would reveal that contract law takes on a more\\n standardized, that is, more numerus clausus-like quality, the more third\\n parties enter into the picture. Consider the problem of the faithless bailee\\n who transfers property to a third-party purchaser for value. The Uniform\\n Commercial Code (U.C.C.) adopts a standardized rule in this situation,\\n allowing those who purchase entrusted goods in the ordinary course of\\n business to obtain good title if they lack knowledge of the bailor\\'s superior\\n claim of title.20 Analogous points can be made about security interests.\\n Security interests are created by contract, but they bind third parties without\\n notice only if strict filing or recording requirements are met.202 And a\\n similar story can be told about organizational forms of ownership, like\\n trusts.

THE NUMERUS CLA USUS AND INSTITUTIONAL CHOICE\\n The numerus clausus also has important implications for the division of\\n authority between courts and legislatures with respect to changes in the\\n structure of property rights. By limiting courts to enforcing the status quo in\\n terms of recognized property interests, the numerus clausus makes the\\n courts an inhospitable forum for modifying existing forms of property or\\n creating new ones. Consequently, parties who wish to secure changes in the\\n pattern  of   available  property   rights  must   look   elsewhere-most\\n prominently, to the legislature. In this part, we argue that the institutional-\\n choice dimension of the numerus clausus is closely related to the basic\\n functional explanation for standardization of property rights set forth in Part\\n III: For a variety of reasons, legislated changes in property forms produce\\n information to third parties at less cost than judicially mandated changes.\\n Standing alone, this consideration does not establish that legislated rule\\n change is superior to judicial rule change. But it helps explain why the\\n numerus clausus-understood in this context to mean a significant degree\\n 203. See Langbein, Contractarian Basis, supra note 65, at 650 (discussing the default nature\\n of trust law in which \"[tlhe rules of trust law apply only when the trust instrument does not supply\\n contrary terms\" (citing RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TRUSTS § 164(a) (1959))).\\n 204. Hansmann & Mattei, supra note 15, at 472.\\n 205. The standardization in each of the examples in this paragraph reduces the costs of notice\\n to third parties about the identity and the assets of the party with whom the third party is dealing.\\n This is different from the standardization of property forms required by the numerus clausus. Our\\n point is that the underlying information-cost economics driving each type of standardization is\\n similar.\\n \\n 58\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n of judicial conservatism regarding innovation in the system of property\\n rights-is a universal feature of modern legal systems.\\n A. The Numerus Clausus and the Source of Legal Change\\n The strength of judicial adherence to the numerus clausus helps\\n determine which institution in society will effect changes in the structure of\\n property rights. The numerus clausus requires courts to respect the status\\n quo with respect to the menu of available property rights. Thus, the stronger\\n the judicial fidelity to the numerus clausus, the greater the necessity of\\n turning to other sources to secure modifications in property rights. In\\n theory, one option is to turn to private ordering. For reasons previously\\n recited, however, this option is unlikely to be useful in most contexts. If\\n private institutions cannot certify the standardization of basic property\\n interests,206 it is unlikely that they can be used to eliminate existing forms or\\n introduce new ones. The only plausible alternative to the courts as agents of\\n legal reform in this context is the legislature.\\n The institutional-choice function of the numerus clausus can be seen\\n most starkly in the civil-law countries, where the principle is expressly\\n recognized to be a central tenet of the code and is enforced quite strictly.207\\n One consequence has been that some of the forms of property that\\n common-law lawyers take for granted do not exist, at least in general form,\\n in the civil law. The most dramatic example is the trust.20 Trusts have been\\n viewed by civil-law courts as a novel type of property outside the list of\\n forms recognized by the code. Consequently, trusts are not permitted as\\n such. The result, not surprisingly, is that the civilians have been forced to\\n rely on a variety of substitutes for the trust, most of them specifically\\n authorized by legislation.209\\n In England, where the numerus clausus is not recognized by name but\\n where the courts exhibit a general conservatism analogous to that which\\n characterizes civil-law courts,210 the \"unwritten\" rule of the numerus\\n clausus has had a similar effect. Notwithstanding Tulk v. Moxhay,\"\\n English courts have generally declined to create new property forms. The\\n result, predictably, has been that nearly all changes in the forms of property\\n 206.

As Holdsworth\\n observed: \"[T]he Legislature has had a larger share in shaping the land law\\n than it has had in shaping any other branch of private law.\"212 For example,\\n there is no judicially crafted action for misappropriation of information or\\n judicially developed right of publicity in U.K. law.1\\n Although the U.S. courts are far more adventuresome than either civil-\\n law courts or English courts, the de facto recognition of the numerus\\n clausus has also had a significant impact in channeling reform of property\\n rights to legislatures in this country. A number of examples are canvassed\\n in Part II. The abolition of the fee tail, dower and curtesy, the tenancy by\\n the entirety, and the tenancy in partnership have been accomplished in this\\n country by legislation, not by courts. And the creation of new interests such\\n as condominiums and time-shares has also been accomplished through\\n legislative action rather than judicial rulings. The fact that it is possible to\\n cite counterexamples in the U.S. context, such as the development of the\\n action for misappropriation of information and the right of publicity, simply\\n attests to the reality that the numerus clausus is a weaker doctrine in U.S.\\n courts, both in terms of express judicial recognition and in terms of judicial\\n behavior. Because the doctrine is weaker, predictably it acts more weakly\\n as an institutional choice mechanism in the United States than in other\\n countries where the doctrine is stronger.\\n B. The Consequences of Making Legislatures the Agents of Change\\n Traditional law-and-economics scholars may regard the institutional-\\n choice dimension of the numerus clausus as unfortunate. One of the tenets\\n of early law-and-economics literature was that common-law rules are more\\n likely to be efficient than are legislated rules214 A central reason for this\\n assumption is that legislatures were regarded as being dominated by interest\\n groups with narrow distributional objectives, whereas common-law courts\\n were regarded as being immune from this type of distortion?\" Scholars\\n who continue to share these assumptions may regard as pernicious a\\n doctrine that freezes further development of property forms by courts and\\n 212.

The numerus clausus from this\\n perspective would appear to consign questions about the design of the\\n property-rights system to the institution least likely to be motivated by\\n concerns with economic efficiency.\\n Yet if we put aside for the moment concerns about the possible\\n distortions of the legislative process associated with interest-group activity,\\n there are a number of features of legislative decisionmaking that make it\\n relatively more attractive than common-law decisionmaking as a basis for\\n modifying or creating categories of property rights.216 These features can be\\n summarized under the headings of clarity, universality, comprehensiveness,\\n stability, prospectivity, and implicit compensation.\" Significantly, each of\\n these features also bears on the explanation for the numerus clausus we\\n develop in Part III-that it is designed to reduce the costs to third parties of\\n identifying the legal dimensions of property rights. Because of these\\n features of legislated change, it is possible that the advantages of the\\n numerus clausus as a rule of institutional choice may offset or even\\n outweigh    the  detriments   traditionally\\' associated   with  legislative\\n decisionmaking.\\n 1. Clarity\\n Legislated rule changes are more apt to be identified as such by the\\n community than are common-law rule changes. This is largely a function of\\n the form in which new rules appear. Legislated rules are set forth in a\\n canonical text which is easy to identify and usually terse. Common-law\\n rules, by contrast, often evolve incrementally through a series of decisions\\n over time. Moreover, they must be teased out of court opinions, which often\\n contain numerous qualifications, alternative holdings, dicta, concurring and\\n dissenting opinions, and so forth.\" Thus, informational intermediaries,\\n such as lawyers, realtors, lenders, title insurers, and trade associations, are\\n apt to grasp and disseminate information about a rule change more quickly\\n and confidently when the change comes about through legislation.\\n 216. For a different view of the relative merits of judicial and legislative modifications of\\n property forms, see Anthony Scott, Property Rights and Property Wrongs, 16 CAN. J. ECON. 555\\n (1983). Scott notes the standardized nature of property rights in the course of discussing the\\n relative merits of litigation and legislation as vehicles for the evolution of property rights. He\\n reaches no firm conclusions about which institution is to be preferred, although he identifies a\\n number of variables that are relevant in making the comparison. Id.\\n 217. Cf. NEIL K. KOMESAR, IMPERFECT ALTERNATIVES: CHOOSING INSTITUTIONS IN LAW,\\n ECONOMICS, AND PUBLIC POLICY (1994) (presenting a theory of comparative institutional choice\\n centered on bias and expertise).\\n 218. 3 JOHN AUSTIN, LECTURES ON JURISPRUDENCE 50, 52-53, 649 (London, John Murray\\n 2d ed. 1863); cf. David L. Shapiro, The Choice of Rulemaking or Adjudication in the Development\\n of Administrative Policy, 78 HARV. L. REv. 921, 941 (1965) (noting that when rules have\\n developed through adjudication, \"even experienced practitioners may be hard put to state the rule\\n accurately\").\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 61\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n This feature of legislated rule change has, of course, a direct bearing on\\n the function of providing information to other market participants about the\\n dimensions of property rights. To the extent that legislated rules are more\\n visible than decisional rules, they will come to the attention of other market\\n participants more quickly and at lower cost than will decisional rules. Thus,\\n the institutional-choice dimension of the numerus clausus reinforces the\\n basic function of the principle: to reduce information costs to other market\\n participants.\\n 2. Universality\\n Legislated rules are almost by definition universal in their application\\n throughout the jurisdiction. A change wrought by the legislature therefore\\n has an unambiguous domain. A new rule legislated by the Congress applies\\n throughout the United States; a new rule adopted by a state legislature\\n applies throughout the state. Judge-made rules, in contrast, often have an\\n ambiguous domain. Decisions by intermediate courts of appeal are binding\\n in only one district in a given political jurisdiction, and may or may not be\\n followed by courts in other districts. In addition, decisional rules may be\\n limited by their terms to certain categories of parties or certain factual\\n situations, with clarification of the scope of the rule left to be resolved by\\n future decisions. Thus, the implementation of a new rule by judicial\\n decision is likely to occur in a piecemeal fashion.\\n The lack of universality associated with common-law rules also\\n increases the costs to other market participants of ascertaining the rule and\\n comprehending the meaning of the rule for their circumstances. This is\\n particularly true in the case of entities that do business in different\\n jurisdictions or in different locations within jurisdictions. Presumably, this\\n is a main reason why intellectual property rights in the United States are\\n typically governed by federal rather than state law:219 Intellectual property\\n rights are distributed in many different states, making a uniform federal rule\\n easier to comprehend and enforce. This feature of legislated rules dovetails\\n with the basic purpose of the numerus clausus.\\n 3. Comprehensiveness\\n Any creation of a new form of property raises a number of questions:\\n What is the range of interests encompassed by the form? Is there a time\\n limit on rights that come within the terms of the form? Who is eligible to\\n hold one of the interests covered by the form? What is the remedy for\\n violation of a right protected by the form? When does the change in the\\n 219. See supra note 70.\\n \\n 62\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n form take effect? Similarly, any abolition of a form of property raises\\n multiple questions: When does the abolition take effect? Are existing\\n holders to be grandfathered in or given other types of transitional relief?\\n What, if anything, will be used in replacement of the deleted form? Courts\\n are at a great disadvantage in addressing these multiple issues\\n comprehensively.220 Courts are limited to deciding specific issues presented\\n by adverse parties in the discrete cases that come before them. It might take\\n years or even decades to flesh out all the dimensions of a particular\\n modification or creation of a form of property through common-law\\n adjudication. In contrast, legislatures can and do typically address all these\\n issues comprehensively in a single piece of legislation.\\n The greater comprehensiveness of legislated rules is also relevant to the\\n information costs associated with rules and rule change. It is cheaper to\\n gather the needed information about all the dimensions of a rule if it is\\n assembled in a single place and at a single time than if it is scattered over\\n multiple authorities that date from different points in time.\\n 4. Stability\\n Legislative adoption of property forms and legislated changes in\\n property forms are also more likely to be stable than are common-law rules.\\n The principle reason for this is that \"legislative production [is] an\\n extremely expensive form of production.\"22\\' It is almost certainly more\\n expensive in the typical case to procure a legislated change in rules than it\\n is to finance litigation designed to achieve a modification in legal rules.222 If\\n the legislature is the only forum for procuring changes in rules, the very\\n expense of securing such changes tightly rations the amount of reform.\\n Fewer reforms translates into greater stability in the dimensions of property\\n rights.\\n A second reason why legislated rules are likely to be more stable relates\\n again to the fact that judicial rules typically emerge piecemeal over time.\\n The composition of the judiciary is likely to change from one decision to\\n the next, especially if the court operates through panels of judges who are a\\n subset of the full court and are selected at random. Thus, the policy views\\n of the judges may shift between the first decision indicating that a rule\\n change is appropriate to subsequent decisions filling out the details. The\\n 220. This was essentially Justice Brandeis\\'s argument for allowing legislatures to develop\\n new forms of intellectual property rights. Int\\'l News Serv. v. Assoc.

A rule\\n that has been around a long time and is relatively unchanging is more likely\\n to be understood because actors and the informational intermediaries who\\n advise them are more apt to have encountered the rule in the past and to\\n have made some previous investment in comprehending the rule.\\n 5. Prospectivity\\n Another advantage of legislated changes in property forms-one that in\\n this case is less directly relevant to information costs-is that legislated\\n changes nearly always operate prospectively.\"\\' Legislative abolition of an\\n existing form or creation of a new one applies only going forward. Hence\\n legislated changes can be tailored so as to minimize the disruptive effect to\\n established reliance interests. Judicial changes in rules, by contrast, apply\\n retroactively to the parties in the case and to all others who have interests\\n implicated by the rule not reduced to a final judgment.224 This is likely to be\\n highly disruptive to existing stakeholders. For example, if the legislature\\n abolishes dower rights, it can do so only with respect to future widows, or\\n only with respect to parties who have not yet married. A judicial abolition\\n would presumably affect widows currently relying on life income from\\n dower estates.22s\\n The greater prospectivity of legislated changes in property rights is\\n relevant primarily to the level of \"demoralization costs\" associated with\\n legal change.226 But it is not entirely irrelevant to our story about\\n information costs. If legal change can occur in a way that imposes high\\n 223. See generally DANIEL E.

In this fashion, a legal\\n regime with a higher incidence of retroactive changes in property forms-\\n and hence a higher incidence of demoralization costs-also is a regime that\\n imposes higher information-gathering costs on other market participants.\\n 6. Implicit Compensation\\n Finally, legislated change in property forms has the advantage that the\\n legislature can devise various means for affording implicit compensation to\\n those adversely affected by the change?\" Courts are at a much greater\\n disadvantage in this regard, since courts will often not have the losers\\n before them and in any event are endowed with a limited set of options in\\n devising remedies. A classic illustration of the ability of legislatures to\\n afford implicit compensation is provided by the abolition of dower and\\n curtesy rights. Dower was a widow\\'s right to a life estate in one-third of the\\n real property held by her husband, curtesy the widower\\'s right to a life\\n estate in all real property held by his wife.28 Typically, when these rights\\n were eliminated, the legislature simultaneously adopted a forced spousal\\n share statute, which generally afforded the surviving spouse of either\\n gender the right to take in fee simple their share of the deceased spouse\\'s\\n estate.229 Thus, the forced spousal share statutes left prospective widows\\n and widowers better off than they were with dower and curtesy rights. If\\n courts were to abolish dower and curtesy rights, they would be at a much\\n greater disadvantage in devising a remedy analogous to the forced spousal\\n share statutes to provide implicit compensation for the legal change.\\n The greater capacity of legislatures to provide implicit compensation,\\n like the ability of legislatures to make legal change prospective, is relevant\\n primarily to the demoralization costs associated with legal change. The\\n ability to provide compensation allows the legislature further to minimize\\n demoralization costs that come from change in a way that courts cannot.\\n Again, however, insofar as legislatures are in a better position to reduce\\n 227.

Legislated Rule Changes: The Final Balance\\n Even if we are correct that legislatures enjoy some inherent advantages\\n over courts in changing property rights in ways that lower the information\\n costs to other market participants, it is necessary to weigh these advantages\\n against the disadvantages of legislative rulemaking. These include the costs\\n of legislative inertia,30 especially in the face of problems that have low\\n visibility and highly dispersed costs and benefits. They also include the\\n dangers emphasized in the literature on public choice, such as interest group\\n domination, cycling among independent options, path dependency, and the\\n like.\"\\' The balance of merits and demerits between common-law courts and\\n legislatures obviously entails a complex judgment as to which no definite\\n answer can be offered. We would, however, offer several observations that\\n suggest that the demerits of the legislative process emphasized by\\n supporters of common-law courts may not loom as large in the context of\\n reforming property regimes as elsewhere.\\n First, the demerit of legislative inertia is in many respects just the flip\\n side of the merit of stability inherent in limiting change to legislative action.\\n Stability and change represent well-known tradeoffs in any legal system,\\n and a system that scores high on stability is likely for that very reason to be\\n slow to change. Thus, it comes as no surprise that property-law scholars\\n frequently complain about legislative inattention to needed reforms, such as\\n simplifying the system of future interests or streamlining the requirements\\n for establishing covenants or servitudes running with the land.32 Overall,\\n however, the legislative record is not that bad. Forms of ownership that\\n seriously interfere with the free circulation of property or otherwise outlive\\n their usefulness, such as the fee tail, dower and curtesy, and the tenancy in\\n partnership, have been abolished in nearly all states.233 And where a\\n significant demand for a new form of property has emerged, as with the\\n condominium and the time-share, legislation establishing these forms has\\n 230. Cf. GUIDO CALABRESI, A COMMON LAW FOR THE AGE OF STATUTES 1-7 (1991)\\n (discussing the general problems of legislative inertia).\\n 231. Cf. KOMESAR, supra note 217, at 138-42 (emphasizing the need to compare the superior\\n expertise of legislatures against the greater risk of bias in decisionmaking). See generally DANIEL\\n A. FARBER & PHILIP P. FRICKEY, LAW AND PUBLIC CHOICE: A CRITICAL INTRODUCTION (1991)\\n (providing an overview of public choice theory); DENNIS C. MUELLER, PUBLIC CHOICE 1 (1989)\\n (same).\\n 232. See, e.g., French, supra note 62; Waggoner, supra note 16.\\n 233. See supra notes 35, 50-53 and accompanying text.\\n \\n 66\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n often spread very rapidly.2 The legislative record is far from perfect. But\\n the areas of inertia may be more the product of a lack of consensus about\\n the proper path reform should take than of any inherent inability of\\n legislatures to respond to demands for changes in property systems.\\n Second, the creation of new forms of property may offer fewer\\n inducements to interest-group rent-seeking than is the case in other areas,\\n such as the revision of tax codes or the expenditure of public monies.\\n Adding a new type of property to the existing options changes the\\n opportunities for the creation of private wealth, but often does not in and of\\n itself create or distribute wealth. For example, if the legislature enacts a law\\n that makes it possible to build and sell condominiums, this does not mean\\n that any condominiums will actually get built and sold. Condominiums will\\n be built and sold only if private capital is diverted to these purposes, and\\n that capital typically will not be supplied by the legislature. Adding to the\\n corpus of property forms is thus an unlikely strategy for any group eager to\\n engage in redistribution of wealth. It is likely to appeal only to those groups\\n who are prepared to invest significant resources in productive activities and\\n who seek legislative change in order to maximize the return they are likely\\n to receive on that investment. In other words, a desire to add to the menu of\\n property rights is likely to be motivated by a desire to expand the size of the\\n pie, rather than to cut the slices in different ways.\\n Third, abolishing or modifying existing forms of property as a means of\\n redistributing wealth is sharply constrained by constitutional protections of\\n property rights. Suppose, for example, that a majority coalition in a state\\n legislature wants to abolish long-term leases of single-family residential\\n housing in order to provide more opportunities for fee simple ownership of\\n single-family homes.\"\\' It is clear that any attempt to do this without\\n compensating the owners of the reversions under the long-term leases\\n would be uncoistitutional. If compensation must be paid, this constrains\\n attempts to use the legislature for such objectives. If the source of the\\n compensation is to come from the beneficiaries of the transfer, then such\\n attempts are constrained even further.236 In effect, the compensation\\n requirement substantially neutralizes any distributional gains from the\\n abolition of particular forms of property. Abolition is thus likely to be\\n 234. See supra notes 54-56 and accompanying text.\\n 235. Cf. Haw. Hous. Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984) (involving a constitutional\\n challenge to a statute permitting the state to condemn a landlord\\'s reversion under a long-term\\n residential lease and sell it to the lessee).\\n 236. This appears to be the practice in many instances where the power of eminent domain is\\n delegated to permit A-to-B type transfers. See, e.g., id. at 234 (reporting that under a state statute\\n condemning a landlord\\'s reversion and transferring it to the lessee, \"funds to satisfy the\\n condemnation awards have been supplied entirely by lessees\"); see also Thomas W. Merrill,\\n The Economics of Public Use, 72 CORNELL L. REV. 61, 85-88 (1986) (discussing the secondary\\n rent-seeking that can come about from A-to-B transfers made possible by condemnation of\\n property).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 67\\n \\n  \\n The Yale Law Journal\\n \\n pursued only in cases where the social gains from the abolition exceed the\\n losses to the incumbent owners.\\n Finally, to the extent that distributional forces continue to play a role in\\n efforts to create new forms of property, it is not clear that these forces will\\n operate with more virulence in legislative than in judicial forums. Consider,\\n for example, the efforts in the United States over the last twenty-five years\\n to gain recognition for a right of publicity. The moving force behind these\\n efforts has been celebrities and their agents, the Elvis Presley Estate,\\n headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, being a notable example.237 These\\n entities have fought for the exclusive right to license the image of the\\n celebrity on coffee mugs and T-shirts, in television commercials, and so\\n forth. It is interesting to note that the courts of Tennessee have been among\\n those judicially recognizing such a right.238 One can readily portray the\\n process by which the Tennessee courts have reached this result as one in\\n which compact and well-organized private interests (Nashville recording\\n artists and the Presley Estate) have prevailed upon the local judiciary to\\n sanction a diversion of wealth from consumers in other states to actors\\n located in Tennessee. Whether the Tennessee legislature, not to mention the\\n U.S. Congress, would be as willing to recognize a property right in these\\n circumstances is open to question.239\\n In sum, the comparison of legislatures and courts as sources of legal\\n innovation must be sensitive to context. Even if legislatures come out ahead\\n in terms of generating rules with lower information costs to regulated\\n parties, there is always the possibility that legislatures will be susceptible to\\n interest-group capture or other imperfections. With respect to changes in\\n property rights, however, there are reasons to believe that these sorts of\\n legislative failures are less pronounced than may be the case in other\\n contexts. This gives us further confidence in saying that the numerus\\n clausus operates as a rule of institutional choice to further the basic\\n information cost-lowering objectives we have identified.\\n VI. CONCLUSION\\n Virtually all postfeudal legal systems draw an important and pervasive\\n distinction between contract rights and property rights: Contract rights are\\n freely customizable, but property rights are restricted to a closed list of\\n 237. See Michael Madow, Private Ownership of Public Image: Popular Culture and\\n Publicity Rights, 81 CAL. L. REV. 125, 136-37 (1993) (noting that the \"right of publicity\\n redistributes wealth upwards\").\\n 238. McCARTHY, supra note 77, § 6.12[A], at 6-84.10 (summarizing the \"mass of\\n complicated lawsuits\" over whether Elvis Presley\\'s right of publicity survived his death).\\n 239. The Tennessee legislature adopted a more limited statutory right of publicity in 1984,\\n but it is unclear whether this applies to personalities who died before the act was passed (Presley\\n allegedly died in 1977). See id. § 6.12[B], at 6-84.12.\\n \\n 68\\n \\n [Vol. 110: 1\\n \\n  \\n The Numerus Clausus Principle\\n \\n standardized forms. In civil-law countries, the numerus clausus defines a\\n fixed universe of property rights, and the principle is rigorously enforced.\\n In common-law countries, the principle has no name and has not been\\n widely analyzed or appreciated. Nevertheless, the principle exists as part of\\n the \"furniture\" of the common law, even in the United States, where the\\n courts are most accustomed to tinkering with established legal doctrines.\\n We have argued that the numerus clausus makes sense from an\\n economic perspective. By permitting a significant number of different\\n forms of property but forbidding courts to recognize new ones, the numerus\\n clausus strikes a balance between the proliferation of property forms, on the\\n one hand, and excessive rigidity on the other. Proliferation is a problem\\n because third parties must ascertain the legal dimensions of property rights\\n in order to avoid violating the rights of others and to assess whether to\\n acquire the rights of others. Permitting free customization of new forms of\\n property would impose significant external costs on third parties in the form\\n of higher measurement costs. On the other hand, insisting on a \"one size\\n fits all\" system of property rights would frustrate those legitimate\\n objectives that can be achieved only by using different property rights that\\n fall short of full ownership. Optimal standardization is the solution, and the\\n numerus clausus moves the legal system closer to the optimum, although\\n we do not claim it generates a perfect mix of forms.\\n By insisting that courts respect the status quo in terms of the menu of\\n property rights, the numerus clausus also channels legal change in property\\n rights to the legislature. This institutional-choice dimension, we have\\n argued, reinforces the information-cost minimization features of the\\n doctrine, because legislated changes communicate information about the\\n legal dimensions of property more effectively than judicially mandated\\n changes.\\n The understanding that property rights by their very nature require a\\n significant degree of standardization has a host of potentially valuable\\n applications in assessing particular issues regarding property. These include\\n proposals to expand the list of available intellectual property rights,240\\n proposals to use digital technology in conjunction with notice to substitute\\n for standardization,241\\' and proposals suggesting that all landlord-tenant\\n issues be resolved in accordance with contract law precepts.242 It also sheds\\n important light on traditional disputes about the appropriate domain of\\n freedom of contract, as well as on more contemporary debates about the\\n 240. See supra text accompanying notes 71-79 (discussing judicial recognition of intellectual\\n property rights under the misappropriation of information and right of publicity doctrines).\\n 241. See supra text accompanying notes 148-151 (discussing the predicted relaxation of the\\n numerus clausus as cheaper forms of notice develop).\\n 242.

But we hope we\\n have said enough to suggest that the numerus clausus is relevant to more\\n than the driest and dustiest aspect of property-the system of estates in\\n land. It is key to understanding one of the law\\'s most important and\\n dynamic institutions.\\n \\n 243.

I would like to\\n thank Kathy Baker, Freddi Lipstein. and Tom Sargentich for their helpful comments on an\\n earlier draft. This draft originated as part of a consultant project with the Coalition of Fed-\\n eral Ombuds, and benefitted from many discussions with members of that group. The views\\n expressed in this Article, however, are my own.\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n INTRODUCTION\\n Learning from the largely beneficial experience in corporate America\\n and in governments abroad, federal agencies have increasingly employed\\n ombuds.\\' Federal agencies use ombuds to work with agency employees\\n and private parties to resolve agency-related problems before they esca-\\n late.2 Dissatisfied employees and members of regulated communities ap-\\n proach ombuds to voice their frustrations and to relay their concerns.3\\n Ombuds then respond to such outreach in any number of ways, depending\\n upon the merit and seriousness of the problem. Because litigation can sap\\n resources and undermine morale, the goal of ombuds is to resolve dis-\\n agreements and complaints at an early stage. Moreover, by providing help\\n to individuals and entities interacting with the government, ombuds can en-\\n hance the image and legitimacy of agencies.\\n No regulatory structure, however, protects ombuds at the federal level.\\n Ombuds largely work at the pleasure of the various agency heads that have\\n hired them. Their duration in office, their independence, and the terms and\\n conditions of their office have yet to be spelled out. The long-term viabil-\\n ity of ombuds may well turn on creating a statutory structure in which the\\n position can be recognized and the conditions prescribed under which the\\n office can facilitate operation of federal agencies.\\n The most nettlesome determinant of ombuds\\' work at the federal agency\\n level so far has been the question of confidentiality. Individuals\\' willing-\\n ness to seek out ombuds rests, at least in part, on the ombuds\\' pledge of\\n confidentiality and their appearance of neutrality. Both confidentiality and\\n I. The terms ombud and ombudsman are used interchangeably. Because Congress\\n used the term \"ombud\" in the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996, 5 U.S.C.\\n § 573(c)(3) (Supp. III 1997), I have used that phraseology in this Article.\\n 2. For an analysis of federal agency workplace ombuds, see generally D. Leah Melt-\\n zer, The Federal Workplace Ombuds, 13 OHIO ST. J. ON Disp. RESOL. 549 (1998), and for a\\n general analysis of all federal agency ombuds see David R. Anderson & Diane M. Stockton,\\n Report for Recommendation 90-2, The Ombudsman in Federal Agencies: The Theory and\\n Practice, in ADMINISTRATIVE CONFERENCE OF THE U.S. RECOMMENDATIONS AND REPORTS\\n 105 (1990).\\n 3. A committee of the American Bar Association recently proposed that an ombud be\\n understood to be \"an independent, impartial person occupying a high status office who is\\n authorized to receive and address in a confidential manner, complaints, and inquiries from a\\n specified constituency concerning acts, omissions, and alleged improprieties of an adminis-\\n trative jurisdiction or associated individuals or entities.\" The definition continues that\\n \"[biased either on such complaints or inquiries or on the ombudsman\\'s own initiative, the\\n ombudsman may (i) investigate or otherwise examine the matter and (2) take appropriate\\n action to aid in the resolution of the specific issue or a broader underlying problem.\" Ad-\\n ministrative Law & Regulatory Practice Ombudsman Committee, Press Release of Febru-\\n ary 17, 1999 (visited Oct. 23, 1999) .\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n neutrality can be compromised if the ombud is later required to provide\\n others documentation of meetings and/or to testify as to confidential con-\\n versations. If ombuds cannot convincingly pledge that communication will\\n be kept confidential, fewer employees and private parties will seek their\\n counsel.\\n Two interrelated questions arise: first, must any information recorded by\\n ombuds about their exchanges with employees and private parties subject\\n such records to future disclosure; and second, whether any common law or\\n statutory privilege protects, or should protect, ombuds from disclosing rec-\\n ords or testifying to the knowledge gained from contacts with employees\\n and private parties.\\n Part I provides an abbreviated summary of the use of ombuds. Drawing\\n from a long and distinguished experience principally in Scandinavia, state\\n and local governments within the past thirty years have experimented with\\n establishing ombud offices. Major corporations have followed suit. Sub-\\n sequently, the idea has taken hold in federal agencies, and the trend is in-\\n creasing.\\n Part II examines the importance of confidentiality. A pledge of confi-\\n dentiality encourages communication to the ombud, vigorous investigation\\n by the ombud, and creation of an atmosphere of trust.\\n Part III examines the impact on confidentiality stemming from the fed-\\n eral recordkeeping requirements currently covering federal agency ombuds.\\n The Federal Records Act (FRA) broadly covers all materials pertaining to\\n \"the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential\\n transactions of the agency . . . .\"4 Paperwork generated by ombuds sheds\\n light on the \"policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of\\n the agency .... , No exceptions apply to most ombud communications\\n with employees and private parties, and thus any written record document-\\n ing such interactions must be retained in accordance with schedules set by\\n the Archivist.\\n Part IV outlines the risks that all such retained records may be disclosed\\n to third parties. Communications with an ombud may be sought by senior\\n agency officials, including those within the agency Inspector General\\'s\\n (IG) office, by congressional committees, by individuals pursuant to a\\n Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, by individual parties through\\n a Privacy Act request, or by parties in litigation. Ombuds, and agencies\\n shielding ombuds, may claim privilege to justify noncompliance with de-\\n mands for information. Under current law, however, the asserted privilege\\n 4. 44 U.S.C. § 3101 (1994).\\n 5. Id.\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n will fail in most cases, and ombuds consequently must disclose records or\\n testify in court if so requested.\\n Finally, the Article in Part V explores potential routes for legislative re-\\n form. I suggest that exemption or radical limitation of obligations under\\n the FRA is unwarranted. Ombud records should be retained as evidence of\\n agency policies and practices and, in any event, an exclusion or limitation\\n under the FRA would not protect ombuds from subpoenas directed at their\\n testimony. Although a blanket legislative privilege is not necessary in light\\n of the incentives at work, a limited privilege is critical as a means of in-\\n vesting the office of ombud with a measure of independence, thereby en-\\n couraging communications by employees and private parties. The Article\\n concludes by recommending that the privilege not be subject to waiver by\\n those communicating with the ombud, but should attach to the office in-\\n stead.\\n I. HISTORICAL CONTEXT\\n The term \"ombudsman\" can be traced to medieval German tribes, but\\n the office evidently has roots in Egyptian government, in the Roman Re-\\n public, and in the Chinese Han dynasty.6 Sweden pioneered with the use of\\n ombuds in democratic government as early as 1809,\\' creating the office to\\n serve as a buffer between individuals and the state. The Parliament ap-\\n pointed the ombud, and the ombud\\'s role was to protect individual rights\\n against possible infringements by executive officials. The ombud enjoyed\\n statutory independence. The office has expanded widely throughout\\n Europe and beyond in this century.8 The principal characteristics of om-\\n buds are that they facilitate communication between disaffected citizens\\n and government, and they remain independent from the control of any gov-\\n ernmental entity. Although no prosecutorial power has been vested in the\\n office, ombuds generally possess an investigatory power coupled with the\\n power to publish their findings.\\n Walter Gellhorn\\'s books in the 1960s widely publicized the use of om-\\n buds in other countries.9 Hawaii was the first state to create a public om-\\n 6.

None of the bills\\n has passed.15\\n Much of the growth in the United States in the use of ombuds has been\\n in the corporate sector.\\'6 Thousands of ombuds currently practice within\\n companies such as Federal Express, IBM, McDonald\\'s and AT&T.\\'7 Hun-\\n dreds of academic institutions have ombuds, as do thousands of health care\\n facilities.\\'8 Most of the ombuds are respected employees of the corpora-\\n tion. These ombuds generally attempt to defuse workplace tensions by\\n acting as factfinders, facilitators, and the like. They enjoy some measure of\\n independence within the organizations, and are generally detached from\\n management in some fashion. They customarily lack the power to shape\\n company policy directly.\\n Federal agencies more recently have followed the trend set by states and\\n corporations. A precursor at the agency level can be found in the estab-\\n lishment of IG Offices throughout federal agencies to investigate allega-\\n tions of waste and other improprieties. With evidence that ombuds at the\\n state and local level successfully served a more informal function, several\\n agencies - in particular, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Environ-\\n mental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Commerce Department - pio-\\n neered by utilizing ombuds in the 1980s.\\'9 The Administrative Conference\\n 10.

Some agency ombuds focus princi-\\n pally on tensions arising in the workplace as in corporations, and some fo-\\n cus on individuals and firms regulated by the agency as in state govern-\\n ments and abroad. Both groups, as in the private sector, can monitor\\n misfeasance or graft within the organization. Uniquely, however, federal\\n agency ombuds through their interaction with members of the regulated\\n public may help lend legitimacy (as well as transparency) to the affairs of\\n government. For all of these reasons, ombuds play an increasingly impor-\\n tant role in agency life.\\n II. IMPORTANCE OF CONFIDENTIALITY\\n Confidentiality is critical to the ombud\\'s work. If ombuds cannot pledge\\n that all communications will be kept in confidence, their ability both to\\n earn the trust of communicants and to investigate allegations aggressively\\n could be impaired substantially. Confidentiality furthers the perception of\\n neutrality that is also fundamental to an ombud\\'s success. In the following\\n section, this Article sketches the harms that may arise from disclosure of\\n communications between ombuds and others.\\n The risk of disclosure may lead to several harms. First, fewer employees\\n or private parties may seek access to an ombud if they fear that their com-\\n munications may be disclosed to others. Little empirical research supports\\n this premise, but anecdotal evidence lends strength to the intuition that em-\\n ployees and members of regulated communities are less likely to share con-\\n fidences when disclosure is more likely. Employees may fear disclosure to\\n fellow employees or to agency supervisors; private parties may fear disclo-\\n sure to competitors or to agency superiors.23 One can safely conclude that\\n the risk may chill some communication without gauging the magnitude of\\n 20. See id. at 190. The American Bar Association has previously advocated for greater\\n utilization ofombuds. See id. at 116-17.\\n 21. See Mary G. Simon, Multi-Association Ombudsperson Networking Directory (Lu-\\n cent Technology 1998) (unpublished directory).\\n 22. See generally Meltzer, supra note 2.\\n 23. Conversely, agency management may worry that ombuds may disclose information\\n it has divulged either to the concerned employees or to the regulated parties.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n the effect.24 Indeed, the pledge of confidentiality is one reason why em-\\n ployees and members of regulated communities are comfortable in confid-\\n ing to ombuds, as to counsel or physicians.\\n For example, consider a bank manager who overhears an Federal De-\\n pository Insurance Corporation (FDIC) examiner making a series of offen-\\n sive remarks to bank employees or learns that the examiner routinely takes\\n three-hour lunch breaks. The manager may fear that relaying such infor-\\n mation to the agency will invite retaliation in the form of a more extensive\\n investigation. Absent a pledge of confidentiality, the manager may decide\\n that silence is the best course of action. Note that the bank manager has\\n less incentive to come forward than individuals generally have to confide in\\n attorneys or physicians. Much like a whistle blower, her principal reward\\n is altruistic, although perhaps she desires as well to protect her employees\\n from a noxious government employee. The importance of confidentiality\\n as an inducement looms large.\\n Similarly, an employee may see a colleague operating a home business\\n through the agency\\'s copying machine. The employee at times may have\\n used the machine inappropriately as well, but never to the massive extent of\\n the colleague. If the employee were not promised confidentiality, the risk\\n of retaliation and disclosure by the colleague might persuade him not to re-\\n port the co-worker\\'s transgression. If the employee\\'s primary motive is\\n selfless, then confidentiality may be warranted as an inducement. Like the\\n bank manager, he has less self-interested reasons for disclosing the infor-\\n mation than a client or patient.\\n For another example, a private individual may contact an ombud at the\\n EPA to report a toxic spill. Informants might not come forward, however,\\n if there were an appreciable risk that their identity would be disclosed.\\n Disclosure could lead to a wide range of repercussions from social shun-\\n ning to violence. In the absence of any tangible gain from the disclosure,\\n the informants - as in other law enforcement contexts - may have insuf-\\n ficient incentive to report the information. Yet the EPA would benefit from\\n learning of the spill even if the ombud cannot divulge how he or she ac-\\n quired the information.\\n Absent other incentives to disclose information to government agencies,\\n employees and individuals interacting with agencies may need encourage-\\n ment to come forward. The public gains from the information so elicited\\n and from the openness of federal agencies to concerns from regulated enti-\\n 24. See generally Eleanor Singer, Informed Consent: Consequences for Response Rate\\n and Response Quality in Social Surveys, 43 AM. SOC. REv. 144, 150-51 (1978) (detailing\\n empirical study finding that more people answer sensitive questions truthfully when prom-\\n ised confidentiality).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n ties and individuals. The prospect of disclosure may chill use of an ombud,\\n and thus frustrate the very reason why agencies created the office.\\n Nor should the lack of hard data be worrisome. Little empirical work\\n documents the benefits from disclosure of any such confidential informa-\\n tion.25 Information in an ombud\\'s possession may largely be duplicative or\\n of marginal utility to a litigant or FOIA requestor. Congress or litigants\\n may well be able to obtain the desired information elsewhere. The lack of\\n tangible benefits on both sides - on the one hand from disclosure and, on\\n the other, from confidentiality- makes a rough balancing approach in-\\n evitable. Courts must weigh the incentive effects as best as possible, cog-\\n nizant of limits of any empirical studies.\\n Similarly, in the absence of confidentiality, agency management may be\\n more reluctant to share information with an ombud. For instance, man-\\n agement might inform an ombud that an employee had threatened co-\\n workers in the past or that an individual had complained about agency\\n practices thirty times during the last twelve months. Or, a senior agency\\n official may disclose the reasons why a particular firm has been targeted\\n for a more rigorous audit. Such information may be of critical importance\\n to an ombud in addressing the situation. Management logically is con-\\n cerned, however, that the information it discloses be kept within the\\n agency. To the extent that the ethic of confidentiality can be encouraged,\\n management as well as employees and others will have more incentive to\\n confide in agency ombuds. Confidentiality facilitates trust.\\n Second, risk of disclosure under the Privacy Act, FOIA, or in private\\n litigation may and has led ombuds to take fewer notes and create fewer re-\\n cords. Instead of writing down dates and names, ombuds may just jot\\n down general thoughts and investigate any complaints or concerns largely\\n based on memory. If the contact with the ombud is complete after an initial\\n interview, the absence of documentation is not of great moment. The om-\\n bud may have proffered advice or clarified options, and no further issue is\\n likely presented. But when a pattern of misconduct is presented, or when\\n the individual makes a series of requests to meet with the ombud, the lack\\n of documentation likely disserves the public interest.\\n To the extent that the ombud\\'s memory is imperfect, continuing efforts\\n to investigate or document abuses within the agency will be impaired. An\\n ombud may forget a pertinent date or confuse a name. Documentation, in\\n other words, can facilitate the effective performance of an ombud\\'s tasks.\\n In addition, the lack of documentation also may frustrate an agency\\'s ef-\\n forts to monitor the ombud\\'s activities. In the absence of any log showing\\n 25. For a general discussion of the empirical difficulties, see Developments in the Law\\n - Privileged Communications, 98 HARv. L. REv 1450, 1477-79 (1985).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n with whom the ombud spoke and what steps the ombud thereafter pursued,\\n the ombud is less accountable for his or her activities.6 An agency cannot\\n easily gauge the amount of resources to devote to the ombud program, and\\n its willingness to support the ombud may wane. The lack of documentation\\n therefore may impede an ombud\\'s ability to act effectively and at the same\\n time impair the agency\\'s ability to oversee the ombud\\'s actions.\\n Third, the lack of confidentiality may undercut the ombud\\'s willingness\\n to function vigorously. Ombuds may try to elicit less information from\\n employees or private parties to avoid learning too much intimate or poten-\\n tially embarrassing information about the communicant. Ombuds would\\n not be faithful to their profession if their inquiries led to damaging expo-\\n sure of information about individuals who had sought their counsel. The\\n ombuds\\' reticence may compound the reluctance of employees or others to\\n convey confidential information if disclosure is likely. The pledge of con-\\n fidentiality, therefore, may bolster ombuds\\' efforts to offer as much help as\\n possible to employees and private parties.\\n Fourth, confidentiality constitutes one important determinant of an om-\\n bud\\'s neutrality. If employees or private individuals believe that the om-\\n bud shares confidences with agency management, then they no longer will\\n view the ombud as a neutral in any dispute or disagreement with the\\n agency. Employees and members of regulated communities might as well\\n raise any concerns directly with supervisors or senior agency officials. As\\n the court in Carman v. McDonnell Douglas Corp.27 noted, the success of\\n ombuds may be closely linked to their appearance of neutrality. An ombud\\n might still be effective at clarifying options and explicating agency policies\\n to the public, in the absence of neutrality, but fewer employees and private\\n parties would have reason to utilize an ombud\\'s service. The pledge of\\n confidentiality is important, therefore, to bolster the ombud\\'s stature as a\\n neutral.\\n Thus, a pledge of confidentiality may be fundamental to discharge of an\\n ombud\\'s functions. Confidentiality encourages communication and trust.\\n The prospect of disclosing such confidences could lead to four interrelated\\n harms. The disincentive for ombuds to make records is of concern, the pall\\n on continuing communications by employees and others to ombuds is trou-\\n bling, ombuds\\' possible reluctance to probe too deeply may frustrate effec-\\n tive intervention, and the perception of ombud neutrality may be impaired.\\n 26.

RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS\\n Neither statutes nor regulations guarantee ombud confidentiality today.\\n Indeed, Congress requires federal agencies to retain all official documents\\n to preserve a record for either contemporary review or historical study. A\\n recordkeeping requirement increases the potential for ultimate disclosure.\\n Materials generated by an ombud\\'or in an ombud\\'s possession must be pre-\\n served as long as they: (1) qualify as agency records; and (2) are retained\\n according to records schedules proposed by the agency and approved by\\n the Archivist, the head of the National Archives and Records Administra-\\n tion, who sets national records policy.\\n A. Records to be Retained\\n Under the FRA, each agency head must:\\n [Miake and preserve records containing adequate and proper documentation of the\\n organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions of\\n the agency and designed to furnish the information necessary to protect the legal and\\n financial rights of the Government and of persons directly affected by the agency\\'s\\n activities.8\\n The directive in the statute is quite broad.29 The Act sweeps within its\\n scope documents relating to all official agency functions bearing on the\\n formulation of agency policy, the conduct of agency personnel, and the\\n agency\\'s impact on third parties. The pertinent regulations specify that\\n documentary materials are records if,\\n (1) They are made or received by an agency of the United States Government under\\n Federal law or in connection with the transaction of agency business; and (2) They\\n are preserved or are appropriate for preservation as evidence of agency organization\\n and activities or because of the value of the information they contain.30\\n Records made by an ombud within the course of his or her official duties\\n plainly fall within the Act. The ombud\\'s actions - just like those of any\\n other agency official - pertain to the \"policies, decisions, procedures, and\\n essential transactions of the agency . . . .\"31 As the regulations require, an\\n ombud\\'s records are made \"in connection with the transaction of agency\\n business .... ,32 The matters brought before an ombud might also concern\\n 28. 44 U.S.C. § 3101 (1994).\\n 29. Furthermore, the agency head must also \"establish and maintain an active, con-\\n tinuing program for the economical and efficient management of the records of the agency.\"\\n Id. § 3102 (1994).\\n 30. 36 C.F.R. § 1222.34 (1998).\\n 31. 44U.S.C.§3101.\\n 32. 36 C.F.R. § 1222.34.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n the rights of \"persons directly affected by the agency\\'s activities,\"33\\n whether regulated parties or the agency\\'s employees themselves. As long\\n as records relate to the ombud\\'s official actions - which, after all are\\n funded by the taxpayer - they must be maintained in accordance with the\\n regulations promulgated under the FRA.\\n Moreover, the form of the record is not material. As long as the record\\n -  whether electronic,34 printed, or handwritten -  pertains to official gov-\\n ernmental actions, it falls within the ambit of the FRA. The Act defines re-\\n cords to include:\\n [A]II books, papers, maps, photographs, machine-readable materials, or other docu-\\n mentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by\\n an agency of the United States Government under Federal law or in connection with\\n the transaction of public business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by\\n that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions,\\n policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or\\n because of the informational value of data in them.35\\n Thus, regardless of whether an ombud writes a report of an interview\\n with an employee,36 receives written information from the employee,     or\\n writes a report, the FRA applies.38 Even a draft of a final report may qual-\\n ify.39 Most documentation of an ombud\\'s contacts with employees or pri-\\n vate parties therefore falls within the purview of the FRA.\\n One possible relevant exception includes personal papers, such as calen-\\n dars or journals of observation about agency work.40 The exception, how-\\n ever, is narrow. The personal papers escaping FRA scrutiny are unlikely to\\n include any notations or summaries made during the course of agency em-\\n ployment to facilitate agency business.41 Notes made \"to conduct agency\\n 33. Id. § 1220.14.\\n 34. See Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, I F.3d 1274, 1286 (D.C. Cir.\\n 1993) (holding that FRA extends to electronic records); see also Public Citizen v. Carlin,\\n 184 F.3d 900 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (upholding Archivist\\'s regulation of electronic records).\\n 35. 44 U.S.C. § 3301 (1994).\\n 36. Cf Bureau of Nat\\'l Affairs, Inc. v.

Nor does it matter whether the agency employee or a third party supplied the mate-\\n rials. See id. at 1495. Thus, if an employee presents information to an ombud, that infor-\\n mation - if written - becomes a \"record\" subject to the FRA.\\n 38. 36C.F.R. § 1222.12.\\n 39. See NATIONAL ARcHIVES AND RECoRDS ADMINISTRATION, DiSPOSITION OF FEDERAL\\n REcoRDs: A REcoRDs MANAGEMENT HANDBOOK 11-3 (1997). Indeed, more than one copy\\n of a single document may be considered an agency record if it serves a different administra-\\n tive purpose. See id. at 11-4.\\n 40. See id. at 11-5.\\n 41. See Bureau of Nat \\' Affairs, 742 F.2d at 1494.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n business\" should be characterized as agency records. As the regulations\\n clarify, \"[p]ersonal papers are documentary materials, or any reasonable\\n segregable portion thereof, of a private or nonpublic character that do not\\n relate to, or have an effect upon, the conduct of agency business.\\'t2\\n In short, given the FRA\\'s directive that all materials bearing on the offi-\\n cial conduct of agency affairs be considered agency records, all notes, rec-\\n ollections, and reports filed by an ombud currently satisfy the Act\\'s defini-\\n tion of \"records.\" Such materials fall within the core of what Congress\\n strived to accomplish in creating a recordkeeping system to ensure that the\\n public (or another agency) has access to files or notes that played a role in\\n the conduct of agency business. All materials generated by an ombud must\\n therefore be retained in accordance with regulations promulgated pursuant\\n to the FRA.\\n B. Length of Retention\\n Congress has vested the Archivist under the FRA with the authority to\\n determine if and when records can be destroyed. The Act states that no re-\\n cord may be \"alienated or destroyed\" except in accordance with the FRA\\'s\\n provisions.43 The Archivist therefore controls the length of time that rec-\\n ords must be maintained.\\n Records such as treaties or Supreme Court opinions plainly have perma-\\n nent value and can never be destroyed. The Archivist mandates that such\\n records be retained by the government in light of the historical or contem-\\n porary political interest. Agencies must transfer those types of documents\\n to the Archivist for safe keeping.44 Indeed, the government\\'s recent deci-\\n sion to retain Abraham Zapruder\\'s film of President Kennedy\\'s assassina-\\n tion permanently in the Archives led to a staggering sixteen million dollar\\n award for Zapruder\\'s estate.5 But the vast majority of agency records have\\n 42. 36 C.F.R. § 1222.36(a) (1998). One could argue as well that notes in an ombud\\'s\\n possession are working papers and therefore exempt from the FRA\\'s reach. The Archivist\\'s\\n regulations provide that working papers need not be maintained if they are not \"circulated or\\n made available to employees, other than the creator, for official purposes.\"  Id.\\n § 1222.34(c)(1). Presumably, working papers ordinarily need not be maintained if they pre-\\n cede a final product. With ombud working papers, however, the papers often are the final\\n product. In any event, the regulation cannot alter the statutory definition of records. Ac-\\n cordingly, such papers likely would be \"appropriate for preservation as evidence of agency\\n organization and activities or because of the value of the information they contain.\" Id.\\n § 1222.34(b)(2).\\n 43. 44 U.S.C. § 3314 (1994). Deference is to be accorded the Archivist\\'s determina-\\n tions under the familiar Chevron framework. See Public Citizen v. Carlin, 184 F.3d 900,\\n 903 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\\n 44. 36 C.F.R. § 1228.24 (a) (1998).\\n 45. See David Johnston, Government Told to Pay $16 Million for Zapruder Film, N.Y.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n more transitory importance. Accordingly, the Archivist may authorize\\n agencies to destroy records when he is convinced that their continued re-\\n tention no longer serves the public interest.\\n Agencies may only destroy records in one of two ways. First, the Ar-\\n chivist publishes schedules authorizing destruction of records after a period\\n of time if consistent with the Archivist\\'s mission of preserving documents\\n of \"administrative, legal, research or other value .... ,\"46 For instance, the\\n Archivist has permitted agencies after three years to destroy correspon-\\n dence with personnel and case files relating to classification appeals, and to\\n destroy records pertaining to EEO background investigations two years af-\\n ter resolution of the case.47 No general records schedule, however, specifi-\\n cally covers an ombud\\'s activities.\\n The closest analogy rests with the schedule governing IG investigations.\\n Under a former general records schedule,48 the Archivist specified that\\n most investigative files (except for those documenting major violations of\\n criminal law or ethical standards) could be destroyed after ten years. Audit\\n files could be destroyed after eight years at the end of the pertinent fiscal\\n year, and investigations triggered by employee complaints could be de-\\n stroyed after five years. If the IG schedule proves a relevant yardstick, the\\n Archivist likely believes that ombud records should be retained for a sig-\\n nificant period of time.49\\n Second, the agency may propose records schedules to the Archivist to\\n enable it to destroy certain common records within a given number of years\\n or even months.50 The Archivist may approve the schedules as long as he\\n or she determines that the records no longer \"have sufficient administrative,\\n legal, research or other value to warrant their continued preservation.,5\\'\\n The agency may request distinctive treatment for materials that the agency\\n believes should be kept longer or shorter than the analogous length of time\\n under a General Records Schedule. The Archivist, however, may disap-\\n TIMEs, Aug. 4, 1999, at Al. The government\\'s decision to keep custody of the film trig-\\n gered the compensation obligation under the Takings Clause.\\n 46. 44 U.S.C. § 3303a(d) (1994).\\n 47. See National Archives and Records Administration, General Records Schedule I\\n (visited Oct. 24, 1999) .\\n 48. The accumulation of exceptions over time led the Archivist to withdraw General\\n Records Schedule 22. See National Archives and Records Administration, General Records\\n Schedule 22 (visited Oct. 24, 1999) . Currently,\\n each agency suggests a retention schedule for its own 1G.\\n 49. Differences certainly exist. Because investigations out of an IG Office may lead to\\n adverse consequences, the individual interest in record retention may be significantly\\n greater. An agency ombud may refer certain matters to an IG Office, but most issues\\n brought to an ombud\\'s attention are resolved short of any further action.\\n 50. 44 U.S.C. § 3303 (1994).\\n 51. Id. § 3303a(a).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n prove the agency\\'s request \"if, after appraisal of the records, the National\\n Archives and Records Administration (NARA) determines that the pro-\\n posed disposition is not consistent with the value of the records.52 Under\\n the statutory scheme, the Archivist must ensure that agencies abide by the\\n records retention policies, and the maximum penalty for the willful and\\n unlawful destruction of federal records is a $2000 fine, three years in\\n prison, or both.13 The Archivist\\'s determination is subject to judicial re-\\n view.\"\\n The assessment of \"value\" is critical to the Archivist\\'s role. Ombud re-\\n cords may have sufficient value to preserve for any number of reasons. For\\n instance, such records may protect individuals and firms who have lodged\\n concerns with the ombud. A bank, for example, which asserts that a regu-\\n latory agency has retaliated against it may find support in notes in an om-\\n bud\\'s possession. Or, an employee, months or years after consulting with\\n an ombud, may wish to document when problems with a particular supervi-\\n sor started. Alternatively, ombud records may shed light on agency poli-\\n cies and reveal weaknesses in certain programs. A pattern of complaints\\n about a particular auditor or type of inspection may suggest the need for re-\\n form. In addition, retention of some ombud materials may be necessary to\\n enable the agency to monitor the ombuds\\' performance in office.\\n Nonetheless, agencies -  subject to the Archivist\\'s approval -  might\\n conclude that preservation of materials in the ombuds\\' possession is not\\n critical. First, agencies plausibly may determine that preservation of sum-\\n maries of ombud contacts suffice, and that the ombuds\\' notes do not have\\n the requisite independent value to justify retention. If an ombud makes a\\n record noting the date and place, sketching the substance of each discus-\\n sion, and including any follow up, most of the value of the original notes\\n can be captured while excluding other possible confidential information\\n contained in the original notes. The more general the summary, however,\\n the less likely that the Archivist will find that the original notes can be jetti-\\n soned. There is, however, no hard and fast rule that all materials need be\\n retained, just those that the Archivist ultimately deems appropriate for\\n preservation in light of their content.5\\n Second, agencies and the Archivist alternatively could conclude that all\\n ombud records be destroyed within months or even hours of creation. The\\n Archivist has considerable latitude in determining whether to agree with\\n the agency\\'s possible assessment that such records do not have \"sufficient\\n 52. 36 C.F.R. § 1228.26(c) (1998).\\n 53. See 18 U.S.C. § 2071(a)(1994).\\n 54. See Public Citizen v. Carlin, 184 F.3d 900 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\\n 55. The Archivist, for instance, has approved the FDIC\\'s schedule retaining computer-\\n ized summaries of contacts with regulated parties with identifiers removed.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n administrative, legal, research or other value to warrant their further pres-\\n ervation.\\'56 As the D.C. Circuit recently explained, the Archivist\\'s deter-\\n mination of whether a record has administrative, legal, research or other\\n value \"is inherently a content-based judgment.57 Thus, the Archivist may\\n conclude that retention of the records only marginally protects communi-\\n cants, only modestly affords insight into the workings of agency programs,\\n and that access to those records is not necessary to permit effective over-\\n sight of the ombud program.\\n There are few benchmarks with which the Archivist can assess the value\\n of preserving ombud records, and therefore little way to predict the out-\\n come of discussions between particular agencies and the Archivist. The\\n Archivist likely would find that ombud records have some value, but may\\n be sympathetic to an agency argument that such value does not warrant\\n preservation because the ombuds\\' mission otherwise would be impaired.\\n Accordingly, the retention period for ombud records may differ from\\n agency to agency, and the period may vary as well depending upon the type\\n of agency record at issue.\"\\'\\n In short, federal agency ombuds must abide by the FRA. Most materi-\\n als, no matter how informal, must be retained in accordance with the Gen-\\n eral Records Schedules. Those schedules, however, may authorize de-\\n struction of notes once adequate summaries are created, and there is the\\n chance that the Archivist will find that the preservation value of the records\\n does not eclipse the potential harms of protracted retention.\\n IV. RISK OF DISCLOSURE\\n The recordkeeping requirements have had, and will continue to have, a\\n profound impact on the conduct of the ombuds\\' office. A variety of parties\\n may seek access to records kept by the ombud, and the threat of disclosure\\n may have a deleterious impact on the ombud\\'s mission.59\\n In comparison to ombud records in the private sector, the risk of disclo-\\n sure is far greater. Parties may seek disclosure of ombud records through\\n 56. 44 U.S.C. § 3303a(d).\\n 57. Public Citizen v. Carlin, 184 F.3d at 905.\\n 58. Some agencies, such as the FDIC, have successfully argued for short retention pe-\\n riods for ombud records. See FDIC Records Retention Policy (on file with author).\\n 59. The threat may cause the ombud to take fewer notes and reduce less information to\\n writing. The reduced documentation may undermine the effectiveness of an ombud\\'s work.\\n In addition, the prospect of disclosure may chill employees or regulated parties from con-\\n fiding in an ombud, frustrating the very reason that agencies created the office. The pros-\\n pect of disclosure may interfere with an ombud\\'s tasks to the extent the ombud is chilled\\n from asking questions for fear of exposing the individual to a loss of privacy. See discus-\\n sion supra Part 11.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n at least five channels: (1) a demand from a senior agency administrator\\n conducting an investigation; (2) a demand from a congressional oversight\\n committee; (3) a FOIA request; (4) a request under the Privacy Act; and (5)\\n discovery in private litigation, which is the only route likely relevant in the\\n private sector.60 Although parts of the records retained may be protected\\n by various privileges, the risk of ultimate disclosure is significant.\\n A. Disclosure Pursuant to Agency Compulsion\\n Agencies have sought to protect ombuds within their agencies from dis-\\n closure requests. Whether the request stems from a congressional aide,\\n from a discovery request in private litigation, or from within the agency,\\n senior agency administrators have utilized resources to protect ombuds\\n from the need to disclose information. They have recognized that confi-\\n dentiality is essential to the effective functioning of the office. Absent that\\n confidentiality, employees would not feel as free to confide in or report\\n concerns to the agency ombud.\\n Despite the essential need for confidentiality, there is no law mandating\\n that agency administrators respect or protect the confidentiality of ombud\\n communications.6\\' The office of agency ombud most often has been cre-\\n ated by virtue of agency discretion, not congressional mandate. No struc-\\n tural protection for confidentiality exists. Thus, each agency can dictate the\\n measure of confidentiality that it deems necessary or advisable to attach to\\n the ombud\\'s office.62 For instance, officials from the IG Office may de-\\n mand information to further an internal investigation. At any time, agen-\\n cies can strip the office of the protections that ombuds currently enjoy, and\\n some agencies have so responded when displeased with the ombud\\'s ac-\\n tions. As one example, the Commerce Department in the 1980s, for what-\\n ever reasons, downgraded its ombud office to a degree that robbed the of-\\n fice of any meaningful role.63 Thus, the risk persists that agency superiors\\n may sap the effectiveness of ombud programs by directing ombuds to dis-\\n close particular information.64\\n 60. There is some chance that a federal regulatory agency may demand information in\\n a corporate ombud\\'s files. See infra note 110.\\n 61. Colorado Senator Wayne Allard recently introduced a bill to ensure the independ-\\n ence of ombuds. See Editorial, Don\\'t Snarl EPA, DENy. POST, Oct. 29, 1999, at B-06,\\n available in LEXIS, News Group File, Most Recent 90 Days.\\n 62. Many employers in the private sector have entered into agreements with ombuds\\n that they will not request the ombuds to testify in any proceeding related to the ombuds\\'\\n work. See Rowe, supra note 16, at 128.\\n 63. See Anderson & Stockton, supra note 2, at 178.\\n 64. See id. at 140 (describing uncertainty besetting one agency ombud as to whether\\n new agency officials would maintain support of program); id. at 178 (noting the problem of\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n B. Disclosure Due to Demand from Congressional Oversight Committee\\n The power of congressional oversight bodies is extensive. Committees\\n may wish to subpoena ombud records to study operation of the ombud\\n system generally, or to examine how agencies handle harassment com-\\n plaints. As Woodrow Wilson once commented, \"[I]t is the proper duty of a\\n representative body to look diligently into every affair of government and\\n to talk much about what it sees.\\'65\\n Accordingly, Congress has imposed a wide variety of constraints upon\\n federal agencies\\' control over information, including not only the FRA\\n previously addressed, but also F01A66 and the Federal Advisory Committee\\n Act.67 Demand for information from an oversight body constitutes just one\\n form of Congress\\'s overall control over the disposition and confidentiality\\n of information in the hands of federal agencies. Congress indeed has\\n criminalized the refusal to provide Congress the information it requests.68\\n Absent a claim of privilege rooted in the Constitution, as with executive\\n privilege,69 there is no basis upon which ombuds can refuse to comply with\\n a congressional request for information. Congress can override any claim\\n that disclosure will intrude upon the privacy of individuals, chill others\\n from using ombuds, or reveal pre-decisional materials that might in other\\n contexts be protected by a deliberative process privilege.70 Congress can\\n back up any demands by threatening to hold ombuds in contempt or to\\n withhold funds from the agency employing the ombud. For example, the\\n Alaska legislature slashed a government ombud\\'s budget because of the\\n ombud\\'s failure to turn over materials one committee had requested.71\\n Thus, in the absence of any congressional authorization for confidentiality,\\n ombud records remain confidential only to the extent of sufferance by sen-\\n ior agency management and by congressional committees.\\n C. Disclosure Pursuant to FOIA\\n Through a FOIA request, individuals may seek access to records kept by\\n the ombud. All agency records are subject to FOIA.72 The scope of a\\n uncertainty).\\n 65.

Department of\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n FOIA request potentially extends to every record required to be kept under\\n the FRA because the definition of \"records\" under the FRA is roughly\\n comparable to that under FOIA.13 There is no requirement that the re-\\n quester demonstrate any particularized need for the information: mere curi-\\n osity will do.74 FOIA represents a broad congressional directive that gov-\\n ernmental records be disclosed upon request.\\n Despite the breadth of FOIA, Congress included various exemptions to\\n prevent disclosure when the harms from such disclosure outweigh the\\n benefits from greater information. Three exemptions may at times shield\\n parts of ombud records from disclosure.\\n 1. First, Exemption 6 shields disclosure of \"personnel and medical\\n files and similar files\" if such information would \"constitute a clearly un-\\n warranted invasion of personal privacy.\"75 The Supreme Court in Depart-\\n ment of State v. Washington Post Co.76 held that Exemption 6 should be\\n construed to apply to all files which apply \"to a particular individual.\" The\\n information stored may be on computer, on paper, or on videotape. Thus,\\n any ombud file, whether framed as notes or a report, can be withheld under\\n FOIA on the ground that a privacy invasion would result.\\n Predicting whether a court would excuse disclosure on the ground that\\n the privacy interests outweigh the public interest in disclosure is quite diffi-\\n cult. Courts have afforded most weight to intimate information in files that\\n would cause embarrassment if released to the public. Examples include in-\\n formation concerning marital status, medical conditions, and legitimacy of\\n children.\" An ombud\\'s notes may well contain information that would\\n trammel privacy rights if released. Allegations brought to an ombud of\\n sexual harassment, of favoritism, or even of frustration at agency misman-\\n agement may disconcert the employee if disclosed. Similarly, an em-\\n ployee\\'s allegations of misconduct by fellow employees might subject the\\n employee to the fear of retaliation. Or, a bank might not wish its competi-\\n tors to know that it had alerted the FDIC to a questionable accounting\\n practice. Indeed, even disclosure of the very fact that an individual con-\\n sulted with an ombud might raise concerns and therefore be shielded under\\n Health & Human Servs., 771 F.2d 1077 (D.C. Cir. 1983).\\n 73. See generally Forsham v. Harris. 445 U.S. 169, 182 (1980); Kissinger v. Reporters\\n Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136 (1980).\\n 74. See DOJ v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 771 (1989).\\n 75. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) (1994).\\n 76. 456 U.S. 595,600 (1982).\\n 77. See, e.g., New York Times Co. v. NASA, 920 F.2d 1002, 1003 (D.C. Cir. 1990)\\n (protecting voicetapes of Challenger astronauts during last minutes of their lives); Rural\\n Hous. Alliance v. Department of Agric.. 498 F.2d 73, 76-77 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (summarizing\\n situations in which privacy interests might be found).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n FOIA.78 There is little question that many of the records in an ombud\\'s\\n files might infringe on privacy interests if released.\\n On the other hand, the public interest in disclosure may outweigh the\\n impact on individual privacy. For instance, the public has some interest in\\n learning of problems of sexual harassment within an agency, and tracing\\n the steps that an agency may have taken, or not taken, in response.79 The\\n public also has interest in whether the agency has mismanaged its mis-\\n sion,80 and in how it conducted \"the operations or activities of the govern-\\n ment.\"81 The Supreme Court has counseled that the overall inquiry into the\\n public interest should turn on whether \"the information sought would\\n \\'she[d] light on an agency\\'s performance of its statutory duties\\' or other-\\n wise let citizens know \\'what their government is up to.\\'82\\n Under that standard, an agency cannot safely predict which portions of\\n an ombud\\'s records ultimately may be shielded under Exemption 6. As-\\n sessing the level of privacy protection is difficult, as is gauging the public\\n interest in disclosure. Then the agency must further speculate as to how the\\n court would balance the competing concerns. No clear metric exists in\\n guiding courts attempting that balance. In any event, all reasonably segre-\\n gable nonexempt parts of a record must be disclosed to a requester.83 Thus,\\n despite the existence of Exemption 6, ombuds may have to disclose part or\\n all of any records in response to a FOIA request.\\n 2. The second possible defense under FOIA is to rely on Exemption 5.\\n Exemption 5 encompasses \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or\\n letters which would not be available by law to a party... in litigation with\\n the agency.\\'8\\'4 As under Exemption 6, portions of records may be subject\\n to disclosure even if other parts are shielded by privilege.\\n 78. Courts have recognized that agencies at times cannot even communicate whether\\n they have any files responsive to a FOIA request without jeopardizing privacy. See, e.g.,\\n Beck v. DOJ, 997 F.2d 1489, 1493 (D.C. Cir. 1993); Hunt v. CIA, 981 F.2d 1116, 1117 (9th\\n Cir. 1992). Similarly, the identity of a client may fall within the scope of the attorney-client\\n privilege.

Id. § 552(b)(5).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n The Supreme Court has held that any privilege commonly recognized by\\n the caselaw can be used to block disclosure under Exemption 5.85 To the\\n extent that the ombud privilege becomes entrenched in the common law,\\n the FOIA exemption would automatically be available at least to shield\\n \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums\" written by the ombud.\\n Strong policy reasons support recognition of such privilege.6 Presently,\\n however, no consensus exists and thus the ombud privilege is not suffi-\\n ciently accepted to apply in a FOIA proceeding.\\n Nonetheless, even if no privilege specific to ombuds would be recog-\\n nized, ombuds may be exempted from complying with FOIA if the infor-\\n mation targeted constitutes intra-agency memoranda - presumably the\\n bulk of ombud records87 -  and would be protected under some more gen-\\n eral privilege recognized at common law.\\n Two previously recognized privileges may be applicable to shield por-\\n tions of ombud records. First, in United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp.,88\\n the Court adverted to a privilege to shield witness statements taken during\\n aircraft investigations.89 The interest in encouraging cooperation in a\\n safety investigation may override any third-party right to obtain that infor-\\n mation. For similar reasons, courts have also protected statements to\\n agency IG during official investigations.90\\n Part of an ombud\\'s task, like that of an IG, is to investigate allegations of\\n agency misconduct or improprieties. In both contexts, a pledge of confi-\\n dentiality helps ensure cooperation in the investigation, thereby furthering\\n the public interest in rooting out any misconduct and defusing tense situa-\\n tions in the workplace. Agency ombuds, in contrast to their counterparts in\\n the private sector, help monitor the conduct of government officials. The\\n public is the ultimate beneficiary.\\n 85. United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U.S. 792, 799-800 (1984) (\"Exemption\\n 5 withholds from a member of the public documents which a private party could not dis-\\n cover in litigation with the agency.\").\\n 86. See discussion, infra Part V.C.\\n 87. Information supplied by an employee or third party, however, likely would not\\n qualify. Neither would factual information be shielded. See EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 87-\\n 88(1973).\\n 88. 465 U.S. at 795.\\n 89. See id.; see also Machin v. Zuckert, 316 F.2d 336, 339 (D.C. Cir. 1963) (recogniz-\\n ing the privilege).\\n 90. See Ahearn v. United States Army Materials & Mechanics Research Ctr., 583 F.\\n Supp. 1123, 1124 (D. Mass. 1984) (protecting confidential witness statements under\\n Weber\\'s Exemption 5 holding); see also Providence Journal Co. v. United States Dep\\'t of\\n Army, 981 F.2d 552, 557-63 (lst Cir. 1992) (protecting IG\\'s investigative report); Pfeiffer\\n v. CIA, 721 F. Supp. 337, 341 (D.D.C. 1989) (suggesting that Exemption 5 protects IG re-\\n port\\'s discussion of confidential sources).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n Many ombud activities, however, do not closely conform to the para-\\n digm of an internal investigation. Ombuds may hear complaints of per-\\n sonal animosities or resentments, or they may serve as a sounding board to\\n help employees or members of regulated communities who are upset clar-\\n ify their options. There is less public interest in encouraging communica-\\n tion of a personal nature as opposed to those that have a more profound\\n impact on public safety. A complaint over a pay raise or work assignment,\\n or an outside party\\'s inquiry into agency regulation, may not rise to the\\n level of a public health or safety investigation that warrants protection with\\n a privilege. Any employee or outside party\\'s discussions with an ombud,\\n as with an IG, may qualify for a privilege, but unless such discussions per-\\n tain to a public safety investigation, the ombud faces disclosure.\\n Second, courts under FOIA have held that deliberative process materials\\n are confidential in order to protect the communications process and en-\\n courage frank and open discussion among agency employees before a final\\n decision is made. The Supreme Court has explained that the privilege is\\n designed \"to prevent injury to the quality of agency decisions.\"9\\' Disclos-\\n ing materials that precede a final decision may only confuse the public.\\n The deliberative process privilege, however, may be inapt for several\\n reasons. As an initial matter, the privilege does not apply to purely factual\\n matters.92 Any factual materials generated in an ombud investigation,\\n therefore, cannot qualify for the deliberative process privilege, even if indi-\\n vidual privacy is thereby compromised. Perhaps more importantly, the\\n privilege does not apply in many ombud contexts because an ombud\\'s acts\\n do not lay the framework for any final decision. An ombud may recom-\\n mend certain action or advise a change in practice,93 but often an ombud\\n strives to resolve disagreements or animosities in the workplace, not rec-\\n ommend a new policy. Moreover, the ombuds have no line authority to\\n implement change, and so any recommendations fall outside the customary\\n chain of command.94 The deliberative process privilege, therefore, rarely\\n affords significant protection for an ombud.\\n 91. NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150-51 (1975); see also Federal\\n Open Market Comm. v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340, 359 (1979) (citing legislative history re-\\n flecting interest in protecting \"agency deliberations\").\\n 92. EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 87-89 (1973); Petroleum Info. Corp. v. United States\\n Dep\\'t of Interior, 976 F.2d 1429, 1435 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\\n 93. If the ombud recommends changes in policy, those recommendations should qual-\\n ify as pre-decisional. See Badhwar v. United States Dep\\'t of Air Force, 615 F. Supp. 698,\\n 703 (D.D.C. 1985) (finding that Air Force Safety Board makes only recommendations\\n which are protected from disclosure).\\n 94. Cf Bureau of Nat\\'l Affairs v. DOJ, 742 F. 2d 1484, 1497 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (con-\\n cluding that EPA makes budget request recommendations but that the President has final\\n decisionmaking authority).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRA TIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n One might expect instead that ombuds\\' notes should be protected to en-\\n courage agencies to evaluate their own shortcomings. Disclosing internal\\n agency criticisms of agency methods and operations may chill efforts at\\n improvement. A self-evaluation privilege at times has been recognized.95\\n In the absence of the privilege, agencies would not be as willing to evaluate\\n and document weaknesses. One goal of ombuds is to encourage those who\\n harbor complaints about the agency to air their concerns in order that the\\n ombud can recommend measures to address problems before they fester.\\n Nonetheless, a self-criticism privilege is not generally accepted. In Holt\\n v. KMI-Continental, Inc. ,96 for instance, the court found no support for rec-\\n ognition of such a privilege in Connecticut.97 As another court recently\\n summarized, the privilege has \"remained largely undefined and not gener-\\n ally recognized by many authorities.\\'g Indeed, the Supreme Court in Uni-\\n versity of Pennsylvania v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission99\\n declined to recognize an expansive privilege to foster self criticism. The\\n university had sought to protect a peer evaluation of a professor. The Court\\n acknowledged the importance of confidentiality to internal review, but\\n concluded that the EEOC\\'s broad need to investigate charges of discrimi-\\n nation in the workplace overrode any such concerns. Thus, no widespread\\n recognition of a self-evaluation or self-criticism privilege exists today.\\n 3. In addition, FOIA provides an exemption for agency records \"spe-\\n cifically exempted from disclosure by statute ... provided that such statute\\n (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner\\n as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria\\n for withholding or refers to particular types of matters as withheld.\"\\'00\\n Arguably, ombud confidentiality is dictated by terms of the Alternative\\n Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 (ADRA), and thus is exempt from FOIA.\\n ADRA now explicitly declares that \"A dispute resolution communication\\n which is between a neutral and a party and which may not be disclosed un-\\n 95.

Disclosure is permitted in vari-\\n ous contexts, particularly if all involved parties consent to disclosure.05 In\\n addition, disclosure can also be ordered if a \"court determines that such\\n testimony or disclosure is necessary to: (A) prevent manifest injustice; (B)\\n help establish a violation of law; or (C) prevent harm to the public health or\\n safety.\"\\'106 These confidentiality provisions might therefore excuse the om-\\n bud from complying with any FOIA request if communications with om-\\n buds fall within the ADRA\\'s terms.\\n The degree to which ombuds fall under the ADRA, however, is unclear.\\n On the one hand, Congress in 1996 amended ADRA explicitly to include\\n ombuds within the definition of \"alternative means of dispute resolution.\"\\n Section 573(3) provides that \"alternative means of dispute resolution means\\n any procedure that is used to resolve issues in controversy, including, but\\n not limited to, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, factfinding, mini-trials,\\n arbitration, and use of ombuds, or any combination thereof.\"\\'17 Ombuds\\n are treated like mediators and arbitrators. Thus, Congress\\'s intent to en-\\n courage resort to ombuds seems clear.\\n 101. 5 U.S.C. § 5740) (Supp. IV 1998). The confidentiality provisions in ADRA appar-\\n ently independently would satisfy the FOIA exemption in that the statute \"(A) requires that\\n the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the\\n issue.\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3). The statute mandates nondisclosure - absent the delineated\\n exceptions - so no discretion is left to the participants in the alternative dispute resolution.\\n In addition, ADRA also \"(B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to par-\\n ticular types of matters as withheld.\" Id.

First, the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms cov-\\n ered must \"resol[ve] an issue in controversy.\"\\'\\'08 \"Issue in controversy\" in-\\n cludes any issue \"which is material to a decision concerning an\\n administrative program of any agency, and with which there is disagree-\\n ment - (A) between an agency and persons who would be substantially\\n affected by the decision; or (B) between persons who would be substan-\\n tially affected by the decision.\"\\'19 Issues brought to the attention of an om-\\n bud may be at too early a stage to constitute an \"issue in controversy.\"\\n Rather, an ombud may clarify other options for a concerned party to fol-\\n low. Indeed, at times no one will be \"substantially affected\" by the issue in\\n controversy. The matters discussed with an ombud might more readily be\\n characterized as concerns or complaints, which have not yet ripened into\\n controversies.\\n Even if the controversy is ripe, personnel disputes may not relate to an\\n \"administrative program\" and thus fall outside the Act\\'s provisions. Ad-\\n ministrative programs \"include a Federal function which involves protec-\\n tion of the public interest and the determination of rights, privileges and\\n obligations of private persons . i.O..\"\\'to Internal agency concerns cannot\\n readily be so described. Some ombud functions pertain to \"administrative\\n programs\" and can be considered \"issues in controversy,\" but a substantial\\n part of ombuds\\' work does not.\\n Second, the ADRA apparently contemplates the presence of adverse\\n parties to a dispute resolution. For instance, 5 U.S.C. section 573 provides\\n that \"[a] neutral may be a permanent or temporary officer.. . who is ac-\\n ceptable to the parties to a dispute resolution proceeding.\"\"\\' Moreover, the\\n Act specifies that the \"neutral... serves at the will of the parties.\"\\'12 Al-\\n though employees and private parties choose whether to avail themselves\\n of an ombud\\'s services, they lack the discretion to choose a different \"neu-\\n tral.\" The confidentiality provision, 5 U.S.C. section 574, similarly ad-\\n dresses communications among \"parties\" and between the neutral and\\n \"parties\" in a dispute resolution proceeding. Often, there is only one party\\n who seeks access to an ombud, and no adversarial relationship ever materi-\\n alizes. No empirical data exist as to how often an ombud acts to resolve a\\n 108. 5 U.S.C. § 572(a)(1994).\\n 109. 5 U.S.C. § 571(8).\\n 110. Id. § 571(2). For a restrictive definition, see In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 148 F.3d\\n 487 (5th Cir. 1998), where the court excludes state programs undertaken pursuant to federal\\n guidelines.\\n 111.  5U.S.C.§573(a)(1994).\\n 112. Id. § 573(b).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n controversy among parties, but anecdotal evidence suggests that the rela-\\n tive percentage is modest.\\n Congress explicitly sought to protect ombuds by including them within\\n the alternative dispute resolution mechanism. Yet, the congressional effort\\n to assimilate ombuds to other dispute resolution officials ignored the sub-\\n stantial differences between ombuds and the others. Ombuds perform a\\n critical function but at earlier stages of a dispute with the hope of prevent-\\n ing concerns from escalating into a full-fledged controversy. Thus, the\\n ADRA exemption to FOIA unlikely covers much of an ombud\\'s work.\\n In short, ombuds currently rely on existing privileges at some peril.\\n Parts of records kept may be protected from disclosure to protect individual\\n privacy. Embarrassing information about individuals could be struck, and\\n there is some chance that the entire record could be withheld as a privileged\\n part of an internal agency investigation. ADRA\\'s confidentiality provi-\\n sions likely apply only to a minority of an ombud\\'s functions. Absent\\n wider recognition of an ombud privilege, the law provides little solace that\\n an ombud could escape the need to disclose records sought through a FOIA\\n request.\\n D. Disclosure Under the Privacy Act\\n In addition to disclosure pursuant to a FOIA request, employees and\\n their supervisors have the right under the Privacy Act to inspect all records\\n pertaining to them. The Privacy Act provides that each agency must dis-\\n close information \"upon request by any individual to gain access to his rec-\\n ord or to any information pertaining to him which is contained in the sys-\\n tem.\"\\' 13 Although an agency can redact any part of the record that\\n threatens to intrude into a third party\\'s privacy, there are no exemptions\\n permitting the agency to withhold the record pertaining to that individual.\\n In contrast to FOIA, the identity of the requestor is pivotal - third parties\\n have no right to obtain such records. But there is no restraint on the re-\\n questor preventing further disclosure.\\n Assume that an employee requests an ombud\\'s records to substantiate\\n when the employee first requested help from the ombud. Or, consider that\\n an agency supervisor might request information because he or she believes\\n that a demotion resulted from employees\\' complaints to an ombud. In ei-\\n ther case, the Privacy Act would require the agency to disclose information\\n naming the employee or supervisor, or any record that \"pertain[ed]\" to such\\n individuals.\"4\\n 113. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(l)(1994).\\n 114. See Quinn v. Stone, 978 F.2d 126 (3d Cir. 1992).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA WREVIEW\\n \\n The Privacy Act, however, apparently tolerates significant agency lati-\\n tude if the records do not name the requestor specifically. The Third Cir-\\n cuit in Cuccaro v. Secretary of Labor115 excused the agency from searching\\n for any information that did not respond to a search by the requestor\\'s\\n name or other easily used identifier.116 Thus, if an agency transcribes\\n summaries of ombuds\\' discussions or meetings with employees and deletes\\n the names of the employees, no such disclosure would be mandated. In ad-\\n dition, if the ombud uses some kind of shorthand abbreviation or code, the\\n file perhaps need not be produced as well. In any event, agencies need not\\n disclose aggregate data drawn from the requestor as well as others.\" \\'7\\n Nonetheless, the Privacy Act increases the risk that the ombud\\'s records\\n will be disclosed. Information pertaining to the employee\\'s consultation\\n with the ombud or relating to subsequent investigative steps by the ombud\\n must be furnished to the requestor. Once in the requestor\\'s hands, there is\\n no continuing restraint barring disclosure to third parties.\\n E. Disclosure Because of Private Litigation\\n Parties involved in litigation may seek ombuds\\' records, or subpoena\\n ombuds to testify for any number of reasons. The ombud\\'s notes, for ex-\\n ample, may document that the agency had been on notice of harassment,\\n may be able to shed light on why an employee was demoted, or may be\\n able to elucidate the history of a billing disagreement between a hospital\\n and Medicare. There has been a significant number of instances in which\\n litigants have attempted to seek information possessed by ombuds to help\\n their litigation cause.\"18 Absent privilege, the ombud has no choice but to\\n comply with duly issued subpoenas as long as the information sought is\\n relevant.\\n Given the incidence of discovery requests directed to corporate ombuds,\\n courts have considered whether to adopt an ombud privilege. As with the\\n deliberative process or the mediator privilege addressed previously, courts\\n determine whether the truthseeking function of the adversary system over-\\n rides the social importance of ensuring confidentiality.\\n Privileges exist to reinforce the vital social utility of various special re-\\n lationships.

Privileges, in other words, frustrate the hoary principle that \"the\\n public has a right to every man\\'s evidence.\"\\'2 Despite the often highly\\n probative information that physicians and attorneys possess about their pa-\\n tients and clients, we generally protect against disclosure irrespective of the\\n pressing needs that litigants may have for that information.\\n In addition to the instrumental concern of encouraging communication,\\n the existence of privileges can at times reinforce the social importance at-\\n tached to the special relationships. For instance, we value the sanctity of\\n marriage, and the notion that one spouse could be made to testify against\\n another strikes us as antithetical to the marriage relationship.\\'21 Privacy\\n therefore constitutes a complementary rationale justifying recognition of\\n some privileges. We value individuals\\' right to express private thoughts to\\n spouses, as well as to trusted professionals such as attorneys and clergy.\\n There is nothing sacrosanct about the ombud-employee relationship,\\n however - as say, between spouses - that would itself justify a privilege.\\n Society may want to encourage resort to ombuds but not because of any\\n intrinsic value of communications between employees or members of\\n regulated communities and ombuds. Thus, the desirability of the privilege\\n turns on the extent to which confidentiality is critical to the effective op-\\n eration of the ombud\\'s office.\\n Federal Rule of Evidence 501 states that federal courts should recognize\\n evidentiary privileges according to principles of the common law \"in the\\n light of reason and experience.\\'22 A party that seeks the creation of a new\\n evidentiary privilege must establish that \"permitting a refusal to testify or\\n excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally\\n predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining\\n truth.\\'23 The Court has suggested that courts principally consider whether\\n the asserted privilege is \"rooted in the imperative need for confidence and\\n trust;\" whether the communication was made in reliance on the pledge of\\n 119. As the Supreme Court explained in Upjohn Co. v.

The very\\n willingness of employees or private parties to seek an ombud for help may\\n turn on the pledge of confidentiality. Employees and members of regulated\\n communities are less likely to confide in ombuds if their concerns will be\\n aired publicly. Moreover, as with attorneys and physicians, ombuds cannot\\n competently perform their tasks in the absence of information. The more\\n that there are significant gaps in ombuds\\' understanding, the more difficult\\n it will be for them to offer advice or suggest appropriate courses of ac-\\n tion.126 In recognition of that need for confidentiality, the Code of Ethics of\\n the Ombudsman Association requires that all members honor confidential-\\n ity for their communications.127 Several states have mandated confidenti-\\n ality by statute.28\\n 124, Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U.S. 1, 10-15 (1996) (recognizing psychotherapist-patient\\n privilege); see also 8 JOHN HENRY WIGMORE, EVIDENCE IN TRIALS AT COMMON LAW § 2285\\n (John T. McNaughton, ed. 1961) (discussing the four prerequisite conditions for privilege).\\n 125. From agency to agency, ombuds may serve different functions. The availability of\\n a privilege may therefore turn on the structure of each separate ombud office. Yet, virtually\\n all agency ombuds pledge confidentiality - with only limited exceptions - as an essential\\n part of their jobs to encourage employees to use their office.\\n 126. The pledge of confidentiality need not be absolute. An ombud presumably must\\n disclose evidence of ongoing criminal conduct and information indicating that someone\\'s\\n safety is in jeopardy. Similarly, attorneys, despite the existence of an attorney-client privi-\\n lege, must disclose any information relating to criminal conduct in the future. That limita-\\n tion has not eroded the benefits of the attorney-client privilege. See discussion infra Part V.\\n 127. See discussion in Carman v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 114 F.3d 790, 793 (8th\\n Cir. 1997). The Code provides in part that \"[tihe Ombudsman, as a designated neutral, has\\n the responsibility of maintaining strict confidentiality concerning matters that are brought to\\n his/her attention unless given permission to do otherwise. The only exceptions, at the sole\\n discretion of the ombudsman, are where there appears to be imminent threat of serious\\n harm.\"    Ombudsman    Association, Code  of  Ethics  (visited  Feb. 11, 2000)\\n .\\n 128.

Confidenti-\\n ality is required by statute in other related settings as well, such as for communications in\\n alternative dispute resolution. Every state but one has enacted a privilege to protect the me-\\n diation process. See generally Pamela A.

Such ac-\\n tions can avoid costly litigation and the rancor that so often accompanies\\n escalating disputes.133\\n The Court, however, was not persuaded of the need for confidentiality\\n for two reasons. First, it chided the corporation for failing to present any\\n empirical evidence showing that ombuds had in fact successfully resolved\\n workplace disputes and thereby avoided costlier dispute resolution. Sec-\\n ond, and related, the Court stated that there was no evidence that an ombud\\n could not be effective in the absence of the privilege. As long as the om-\\n bud could guarantee that any communication would not be passed on to the\\n employees\\' superiors in the corporation, the Court believed that employees\\n would likely still use the ombud.34 In other words, the risk of disclosure in\\n a lawsuit was so remote that any chill on communications would be slight.\\n Similarly, the Court found that the corporation\\'s public policy argument\\n that management would not share sensitive information with an ombud in\\n the absence of the privilege was speculative. No documentation backed up\\n the corporation\\'s claim that use of ombuds would tail off in the absence of\\n confidentiality.131\\n On balance, therefore, the Court in Carman concluded that no substan-\\n tial public purpose would be served by recognizing the privilege. The\\n harms from refusal to disclose outweighed the speculative impingement on\\n the efficacy of the ombud\\'s role in the corporation. Consequently, the\\n 129.

See supra notes 1,102.\\n 140. See supra text accompanying note 112.\\n 14 1. Congress has encouraged the use of ombuds in a number of settings. See 10 U.S.C.\\n § 2304c(e) (1994) (directing agency ombud to oversee procurement process); 12 U.S.C.\\n § 4806 (1994) (directing banking agencies to act as liaison with regulated parties and all af-\\n fected persons); 15 U.S.C. § 2051 (1994) (establishing agency ombuds to monitor construc-\\n tion contracts); 15 U.S.C. § 657 (Supp. III 1997) (directing ombud in Small Business Ad-\\n ministration to work with small business concerns); 20 U.S.C. § 1018 (1994) (designating a\\n student loan ombud to provide assistance to borrowers of loans made, insured, or guaran-\\n teed): 22 U.S.C. § 290-m2 (1994) (directing President to appoint ombud to work with public\\n in carrying out community adjustment and investment program); 22 U.S.C. § 3623 (1994 &\\n Supp. II1 1997) (establishing ombud office to receive complaints and requests related to op-\\n eration of the Panama Canal); 42 U.S.C. § 6908(d) (1994) (establishing ombud in environ-\\n mental program to help small towns planning and financing environmental facilities).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n confidentiality is compelling. Given that the use of ombuds in this nation\\n is of relatively recent origin, courts may become more sympathetic to\\n claims of privilege as the ombuds\\' practice widens. In the context of alter-\\n native dispute resolution, no privilege of confidentiality was recognized for\\n years. Whatever the future prospects, ombuds today cannot rely on any\\n common law privilege to protect the confidentiality of communications\\n with employees and private parties.\\n Moreover, it is not clear that any such privilege would be absolute.\\n Most privileges must be balanced against the need for information in the\\n given context presented. For instance, the deliberative process and jour-\\n nalist source privileges both are limited. A strong showing of need can\\n override assertions of either privilege.142 As another example, in United\\n States v. Nixon43 the Supreme Court recognized a presidential privilege to\\n protect against disclosure of President Nixon\\'s tapes, yet found that the\\n need for such information in a criminal proceeding was paramount: \"The\\n very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system\\n depend on full disclosure of all the facts ... it is imperative to the function\\n of courts that compulsory process be available for the production of evi-\\n dence needed either by the prosecution or by the defense.\\'  To the Court,\\n the rare need for disclosure in a criminal proceeding would not signifi-\\n cantly erode reliance on a confidential pledge or relationship.\\n Legislatures as well have enacted conditional privileges. In the ADRA,\\n Congress limited the privilege so that disclosure could be made \"to prevent\\n manifest injustice,\" \"to help establish a violation of law,\" or \"prevent harm\\n to the public health or safety.\\'45 States have enacted limits on the attor-\\n ney-client and physician-patient privileges.46 Thus, not only is the pros-\\n pect for recognizing a common law ombud privilege uncertain, but the\\n privilege might provide only imperfect protection for an ombud wishing to\\n pledge total confidentiality.\\n Any written material in an ombud\\'s control, therefore, may be subject to\\n disclosure. Whether the inquiry stems from Congress, senior agency man-\\n 142. See supra notes 91-95; infra note 160.\\n 143. 418 U.S. 683 (1974).\\n 144. Id. at 709.\\n 145. 5 U.S.C. § 574(a)(4) (1994 & Supp. IV 1998). In addition, the proposed Rules of\\n Federal Evidence included several privileges that were not enacted by Congress. The attor-\\n ney-client privilege proposed, for instance, would have recognized five exceptions: \"Fur-\\n therance of crime or fraud, claimants through same deceased client, breach of duty by law-\\n yer or client, document attested by lawyer, and joint clients.\" 56 F.R.D. 183 (1972).\\n Several exceptions also existed for the proposed psychotherapist privilege and marital\\n privilege. See Ronald J. Allen & Cynthia M. Hazelwood, Preserving the Confidentiality of\\n Internal Corporate Investigations, 12 J. CORP. L. 355, 380 (1987).\\n 146. See infra note 159 (setting forth limitations in Virginia and North Carolina).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n agement, involved parties, or a journalist, the ombud may have to disclose\\n the information sought. Even when privilege attaches, it may not protect\\n the entire document, and may only be qualified.\\n V. NEED FOR REFORM\\n Given the porousness of the privileges currently available, ombuds face\\n the prospect that they will be required to testify in court or produce records\\n of their communications. Even if the likelihood is small, the very possibil-\\n ity adversely may impact ombuds\\' effectiveness and the willingness of pri-\\n vate parties to seek their counsel.\\n Congress might address the threatened loss of confidentiality in several\\n ways. It might exempt ombuds from the FRA and FOIA altogether; it\\n might reduce the amount of time that agencies must keep ombud records\\n under the FRA if agencies are not successful in accomplishing that goal on\\n their own; or it might enact a statutorily based privilege for ombuds. Each\\n of the options has drawbacks, and all would help place confidential com-\\n munications with an ombud on more secure footing. Only a legislatively-\\n enacted privilege, however, can sufficiently protect confidentiality in light\\n of the myriad pressures for disclosure. At the same time, limitations on any\\n statutorily mandated confidentiality are warranted to protect the public\\'s\\n need for that information in exceptional contexts.\\n A. Exemption from the Federal Records Act\\n Congress unquestionably has the power to exempt ombuds from the\\n reach of the FRA. If such an exemption were enacted, ombuds could take\\n notes, record any discussions, and later destroy all documentation. Ulti-\\n mately, there would be no records subject to a request under either FOIA or\\n the Privacy Act. Exempting ombuds from the FRA, however, would be\\n both over and under-inclusive.\\n With respect to over-inclusiveness, an FRA exemption would frustrate\\n the legitimate objectives animating the FRA\\'s enactment. At least some\\n ombud records can be important to protect the rights of the communicant or\\n to facilitate the study of an agency\\'s activities by an outsider. For instance,\\n consider a sexual harassment case. In that context, the date on which alle-\\n gations of harassment were first made - or the level of specificity at which\\n they were raised - may be critical.147 Yet parties involved in a lawsuit\\n would not be able to obtain any documentation of such information from an\\n ombud because of the exemption. Similarly, in an investigation into\\n 147. In fact, a controversy currently exists as to whether disclosure to an ombud consti-\\n tutes notice to a corporation.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n agency waste or fraud, an ombud\\'s notes from witnesses might prove quite\\n material. The absence of such notes harms the efforts of involved indi-\\n viduals, either to clear themselves or prove another\\'s responsibility. Con-\\n gress required records to be retained in order to benefit those interacting\\n with the government, and to ensure that sufficient information be kept to\\n enable study of government activities.\\n With respect to under-inclusiveness, an FRA exemption will not excuse\\n an ombud\\'s duty to testify in court. Even if no records were required to be\\n kept, therefore, the potential for disclosure would remain. Any employee\\n or private party communicating with an ombud would know that their\\n communications might be divulged if the ombud were subpoenaed. In ad-\\n dition, there is nothing preventing the employee or private party from testi-\\n fying to discussions with the ombud. Indeed, it was the former employee\\n in Carman who willingly disclosed the prior contacts.148 Any exception\\n from the FRA, therefore, will not assure the confidentiality of the ombuds\\'\\n tasks.\\n Testimony, like disclosure of records, undermines the confidentiality\\n that arguably is essential to an ombud\\'s tasks. Each time that an ombud is\\n deposed or forced to testify in court undermines the original pledge of con-\\n fidentiality. Whether the pledge is eroded more by oral testimony or dis-\\n closure of documents is beside the point. Indeed, the publicity afforded the\\n disclosure might be more important than the medium. Whatever the im-\\n pact, an exemption from the FRA would not assure complete confidential-\\n ity.\\n Finally, excluding ombuds from the reach of the FRA will not extend the\\n ombud any protection from senior agency officials or members of Con-\\n gress. Agency officials can require ombuds not only to retain records, but\\n also to disclose them to senior management or officials within the agency\\'s\\n IG Office. Similarly, the prospect of a congressionally mandated disclo-\\n sure exists. Ombuds currently cannot rely upon any structural check to\\n preserve confidentiality from management or congressional inquiry. In\\n short, an exception from the FRA seems poorly tailored to balance the\\n competing concerns of confidentiality and providing more information to\\n interested parties and the public.\\n B. Limited Retention Obligation\\n Ombuds could be protected in a different way if agencies\\' obligation to\\n retain their records were shortened, even if not eliminated. Agencies cur-\\n rently may propose to the Archivist limitations on the retention period for\\n 148. Under the Privacy Act, those obtaining information in government records about\\n themselves have no duty to keep that information private.\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n ombud documents. Legislative intervention may be needed, however, for\\n two reasons. First, agencies may decline to request such shortened periods\\n for any number of reasons,149 and second, the Archivist may rebuff any\\n such efforts on the ground that ombud records retain \"sufficient . . .\\n value.\"150 Congress therefore might determine that a three month retention\\n period after a case became dormant was sufficient.5\\'\\n Minimizing the retention period would lead to several advantages for the\\n ombuds. First, there would be less likelihood that ombuds would have to\\n disclose documents in litigation as most litigation would not have pro-\\n ceeded to the discovery phase within the short period after an individual or\\n employee concluded contacts with an ombud. Similarly, most FOIA re-\\n quests would be made outside that time period, and requests under the Pri-\\n vacy Act within the period would likely be few and far between. Few re-\\n quests for information are made directly after an initial contact with an\\n agency official such as an ombud. On the whole, shortening the time pe-\\n riod would therefore shield the ombud from much disclosure.\\'52\\n At the same time, other benefits would arise from the shortened retention\\n requirements. In light of the extra protection, ombuds arguably would have\\n the incentive to document more of their discussions with employees and\\n private parties. That extra documentation in turn might help the ombuds\\n pursue their tasks more effectively because they could keep the information\\n divulged by employees and others -   whether names, dates, or places -\\n more clear in their minds, at least for the three-month period. Agencies\\n wishing to monitor their ombuds\\' performance in office could also assess\\n the paper trail more adequately.\\n Finally, the documentation may benefit outsiders to the agency, includ-\\n ing affected parties, by affording a longer glimpse into the ombud\\'s activi-\\n ties. For instance, if an employee wishes to gain support for his or her liti-\\n gation position from an ombud record, a Privacy Act request or subpoena\\n would be honored if made relatively soon after the contacts with the ombud\\n subsided. Similarly, a congressional oversight committee studying the use\\n 149. For instance, the agency may in good faith differ with the ombud as to the defini-\\n tion of \"value\" in the FRA, or the agency may wish a lengthened retention period for its\\n own purposes of ensuring greater monitoring of agency programs and policies.\\n 150. 44 U.S.C. § 3303a(a) (1994).\\n 151. A three-month period, for example, is far shorter than the five-year period in which\\n IG\\'s had to retain investigative files under the former General Records Schedule 22. See\\n supra note 48 and accompanying text.\\n 152. Corporate ombuds as well have been advised to shorten the retention period for\\n records. See William L. Kandel & Sheri L. Frumer, The Corporate Ombudsman and Em-\\n ployment Law: Maintaining the Confidentiality of Communications, 19 EMPLOYEE REL. L.J.\\n 587, 589 (1994) (describing minimal recordkeeping as a safeguard against disclosure and\\n retaliation).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n of ombuds could evaluate ombud records made within the preceding three\\n months even if other records had been destroyed. In short, the extra incen-\\n tive to record information may well redound to the public interest.\\n Nonetheless, the short retention option is hardly a panacea. First, from\\n the Archivist\\'s perspective, the duration may be too short to accomplish the\\n purposes underlying the recordkeeping requirement: safeguarding the \"ad-\\n ministrative, legal, research, or other value\" of the records.\\'53 Three\\n months might not allow sufficient monitoring of an ombud or protection for\\n third parties involved in an ombud\\'s investigation. Indeed, many problems\\n at a workplace may be recurring, so that the chief value of record keeping\\n is the documentation that harassment or drinking had taken place previ-\\n ously.54 Second, from the ombud\\'s perspective, the enhanced risk of dis-\\n closure may either erode an employee\\'s willingness to confide in an ombud\\n or chill the ombud\\'s willingness to record data. Moreover, as with the op-\\n tion of eliminating the record requirement altogether, the shortened reten-\\n tion option does not address the problem of subpoenas in litigation that\\n seek the testimony, as opposed to notes, of an ombud. Neither does it af-\\n ford the ombud any protection from meddlesome agency managers. Al-\\n though shortening the period used constitutes an improvement on the cur-\\n rent system, the shortened retention compromise fails to address the\\n problem of testimony, only partially addresses the problem of written\\n documents, and perhaps insufficiently safeguards the public interest in pre-\\n serving access to ombud records.\\n C. Legislatively-Enacted Privilege\\n Instead of tinkering with the records requirement, Congress should pro-\\n tect ombuds by legislatively recognizing a privilege. Congress has enacted\\n privileges in other contexts such as under the ADRA and in recent banking\\n legislation.55 The advantage of congressional action is considerable -\\n only legislative action can protect an ombud both from disclosure of docu-\\n ments and from testifying in litigation. A congressional enactment can also\\n protect ombuds from subpoenas issued by congressional committees or\\n from demands from senior agency management. Any enacted ombud\\n privilege, therefore, might shield ombuds from the need to disclose records\\n in response to a Privacy Act request, to a demand pursuant to FOIA, to a\\n 153. 44 U.S.C. § 3303a(d)(1994).\\n 154. A case with an ombud is never closed as firmly as with a discrete litigation matter.\\n The problematic conduct can resurface, or new episodes may shed light on prior problems.\\n 155. Congress has provided that ombuds working with banking agencies \"assure that\\n safeguards exist to encourage complainants to come forward and preserve confidentiality.\"\\n 12 U.S.C. § 4806(d)(2)(B) (1994).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n request from Congress or a top agency official, or from a subpoena in pri-\\n vate litigation.\\n Moreover, a congressional measure would reinforce the social impor-\\n tance of resolving disputes short of litigation. The legislation would send a\\n signal of encouragement to members of the public and agency employees\\n to avail themselves of the ombud office, and remind all of the alternatives\\n open for de-escalating disputes. Congressional sanction might promote\\n wider use, and lend additional legitimacy to agency action.\\n 1. The legislatively created privilege need not be absolute. Congress\\n could specify the conditions under which ombuds must comply with re-\\n quests for documents and testimony. A showing of particularized need by\\n the requestor might outweigh the desideratum of confidentiality in several\\n contexts. Demand for information in an ombud\\'s hands for use in a crimi-\\n nal proceeding, as in United States v. Nixon, might outweigh the ombud\\'s\\n interest in confidentiality. The same might be true for inquiries into gov-\\n ernment waste or fraud. Or, the privilege might be waived by parties\\n communicating with the ombud, and they could subpoena documentation\\n or testimony with respect to prior contacts. Many options for qualifying a\\n legislative privilege exist.\\n Nor might a blanket privilege be absolutely necessary to protect the om-\\n bud\\'s interest in confidentiality.56 To be sure, with each exceptional con-\\n text in which testimony must be given or documents produced, the pledge\\n of confidentiality is commensurately eroded. Employee or private party\\n willingness to use an ombud may be diminished, as might the eagerness\\n with which senior agency management confides in an ombud. Ombuds\\n themselves might become less willing to probe too deeply for fear of ulti-\\n mate disclosure of private information. Moreover, as discussed previously,\\n the ombud\\'s documentation of conversations may become more sparse as\\n incidents of forced disclosure mount.\\n Restrictions on other privileges, however, suggest that qualified privi-\\n leges can be effective in preserving sufficient confidence in the communi-\\n cations so as not to impede the flow of information. In fact, few pledges of\\n confidentiality under our legal system are absolute. The attorney-client\\n privilege does not extend to continuing criminal conduct;\\'57 the physician-\\n 156.

Individuals used\\n psychotherapists long before any privilege was recognized. 163\\n Although individuals may have greater incentive to communicate in the\\n above contexts than they do in the ombud setting, inducements to bring in-\\n formation to an agency ombud\\'s attention exist as well. An employee may\\n wish to question why he or she was passed over for a promotion. Or, a\\n firm may inquire as to the conditions under which field examinations may\\n take place.\\n Moreover, the risk of disclosure of private information has not chilled\\n communication in a wide variety of other contexts. People use credit cards\\n knowing that such information may be bought and sold; they use shopping\\n discount cards that can yield third parties a rich array of information as to\\n their customer preferences; and they may wander through the Internet de-\\n spite the traces that can be placed on each person\\'s browsing.\\n The reasons for the risk-taking are many, but at least four have relevance\\n here. First, there may be an information asymmetry. Those interacting\\n with the ombud may not appreciate that their communications are subject\\n to disclosure. They may not be familiar with the FOIA or the workings of\\n IG offices. Furthermore, any request for ombud documents is unlikely to\\n make the front page of the Washington Post, so that employees or private\\n 158.

Correspondingly, to the extent that the lack of a privilege does not chill communi-\\n cation, records of such communications will be available when necessary to satisfy a FOIA\\n request or further the truth-seeking role of a judicial proceeding. On the other hand, if there\\n would be an activity-level effect, then there would be less information available (because of\\n the less frequent communications to ombuds) and hence less public interest overall in en-\\n suring that such information be disclosed upon request.\\n 162.

Just as someone using\\n a credit or grocery store savings card may not recognize the many uses to\\n which information about their transactions may be deployed, so employees\\n or private parties may lack knowledge about the risks of forced disclosure\\n after communicating with an ombud.\\n Employees and members of regulated communities can only expect con-\\n fidentiality to the extent pledged by the ombud. Ombuds should address\\n the risk of disclosure prior to communicating with the employee or private\\n party. That communication, however, will not likely close the information\\n gap completely unless the ombud provides a lengthy description of the le-\\n gal process and the various contexts that may arise in which disclosure\\n could be ordered. An ombud might identify that a small risk of disclosure\\n exists and leave it at that. In any event, unless ombuds launch into detailed\\n scenarios, the employee or third party will only have a general sense of the\\n risks. They may communicate with the ombud not fully appreciating the\\n risk of ultimate disclosure.\\n Second, even if the risks of disclosure are known, those communicating\\n likely underestimate such risks. Employees and members of regulated\\n communities bringing disputes or raising issues with ombuds do so in the\\n expectation that their concerns can be addressed far short of litigation.\\n They may not want litigation, or may expect that their grievance can be re-\\n solved quickly without the need to resort to litigation. They may discount\\n the chance, therefore, that their particular dispute with the agency will es-\\n calate to such a degree that litigation will become necessary. They may\\n also consider the chance of a FOIA request to be extremely remote.\\'64 In-\\n deed, many individuals in general underestimate risks attached to their\\n conduct. 165\\n This over-optimism may be reinforced by the fact that individuals assess\\n the likelihood that any event will transpire based on their past experi-\\n ences.66 Given that employees and private parties are unlikely to be aware\\n 164. Employees are unlikely to think that their concerns will be of great interest to out-\\n siders.\\n 165. See Christine Jolls, Behavioral Economic Analysis of Redistributive Legal Rules,\\n 51 VAND.

As Justice Scalia asked with respect to the psychotherapist privilege recognized in\\n Jaffe, \"[I1s it really true that most, or even many, of those who seek psychological counsel-\\n ing have the worry of litigation in the back of their minds?\" Jaffe, 518 U.S. at 24 (Scalia, J.,\\n dissenting).\\n 166.

REv. 1175, 1189-90 (1997) (explaining individuals\\' \"bias toward the perceived\\n outcome and hindsight\").\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n of any instance in which an ombud\\'s notes have become public, they may\\n discount that possibility. Thus, if anything, many interacting with ombuds\\n are likely to underestimate the chance that their dispute will roil to the point\\n where someone else will demand access to the ombud\\'s notes or testimony.\\n Third, the risk of disclosure may not chill communication because it is a\\n risk that some individuals will willingly accept. Individuals, for instance,\\n may welcome the potential for disclosure pursuant to the Privacy Act, be-\\n cause such disclosures should prove of principal benefit to them. Moreo-\\n ver, those communicating with ombuds are the likeliest litigants to seek ac-\\n cess to ombud documents in litigation, as in the Carman and Shabazz cases\\n discussed earlier. Unlike the attorney-client or physician-patient privilege,\\n it is the communicant in this context who often seeks to breach the confi-\\n dentiality.\\n The importance of the distinction should not be underestimated. It is a\\n comparatively rare case wherea third party seeks disclosure of confidential\\n materials in an ombud\\'s file, as occurs with some frequency in the attorney\\n and physician settings. Rather, the genesis for disclosure often, but not ex-\\n clusively, stems from the communicant.167 Only when the prospect of re-\\n taliation or embarrassment would be very high would employees or mem-\\n bers of regulated communities need assurances of confidentiality.\\n Otherwise, individuals might welcome the fact that a trusted agency official\\n shared their knowledge of agency misfeasance or inefficiency.\\n Fourth, employees and private parties might have sufficient incentive to\\n continue communicating with ombuds irrespective of the risk of disclosure.\\n Although the incentives are stronger for patients in the absence of privilege\\n to communicate with physicians than for employees and others to approach\\n ombuds, there are nonetheless reasons to believe that ombuds would still be\\n utilized. The question turns on the options available to employees and pri-\\n vate parties interacting with government. For example, when employees or\\n members of regulated communities confront a problem, the options avail-\\n able to the individuals include: ignoring the privilege, making whatever ac-\\n commodation is necessary with the hope that the problem does not get\\n worse; consulting an attorney or union representative if relevant to press a\\n claim on their behalf; bringing their problems to an agency supervisor; or\\n consulting an ombud, knowing that there is some risk of ultimate disclo-\\n sure. The option of doing nothing may be extremely unattractive if the\\n situation at the workplace or with agency regulators is too tense. Contact-\\n 167. Employees and others confiding in ombuds expect that ombuds will not divulge\\n their conversations with other affected employees and supervisors. If ombuds printed all\\n conversations in agency newsletters, then the chill on future communication would be quite\\n great. But the slim prospect of subsequent disclosure to a court or requestor under FOIA\\n will not have as marked an activity-level effect.\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n ing an attorney generally takes resources and raises the ante. Similarly, in-\\n volving a union representative may have untoward consequences particu-\\n larly if other union members are involved. Moreover, confiding in a super-\\n visor might result in embarrassment and could be futile if the problems\\n originated at a high level within the agency, and might invite retaliation.\\n Thus, by default, communicating with an ombud may be the best option\\n even with a modest risk of disclosure.\\n This is not to suggest that confidentiality does not play a pivotal role in\\n encouraging communication from employees and others. What may be\\n most critical, however, are assurances that the ombud is independent of\\n formal agency control and that the ombud not disclose any complaint or\\n concern to an agency manager.68\\n Experience with other privileges bears out this premise, albeit not con-\\n clusively. For instance, empirical studies of the journalist privilege suggest\\n that the pledge of confidentiality plays only a limited role in eliciting dis-\\n closure to a journalist in comparison to confidence in the journalist\\'s dis-\\n cretion.169 Studies of the attorney-client privilege also reveal that attor-\\n neys\\' reputations may be as important as any guarantee of confidentiality in\\n encouraging disclosure. 17 Patients as well largely volunteer information as\\n long as the physician is trusted, irrespective of any pledge of confidential-\\n ity.\"\\' An ombud\\'s pledge of confidentiality may be most important as a\\n means of creating an image of neutrality or separation from agency man-\\n agement. That guarantee of independence, as much as any pledge of confi-\\n dentiality, instills faith in the ombud\\'s office. But complete confidentiality\\n may not be essential.\\n 168. Disclosure pursuant to a court order likely is not as problematic. Empirical evi-\\n dence in other privilege contexts suggests that individuals are far more concerned about dis-\\n closure to employers than to a court. See Edward Imwinkelreid, The Rivalry Between Truth\\n and Privilege: The Weakness of the Supreme Court\\'s Instrumental Reasoning in Jaffe v.\\n Redmond, 518 US. 1 (1996), 49 HASTINGS L.J. 969, 977-78 (1998).\\n 169.

Identifying the limited situations in which the need for information\\n possessed by the ombud overrides the interest in confidentiality is quite\\n daunting. The greater the number of exceptions and the degree of vague-\\n ness, the less the expectation of confidentiality. The political problem of\\n generating agreement on a list of exceptions compounds the difficulty.\\n The compromise struck by the ADRA, however, provides a useful start-\\n ing point both as a matter of precedent and politics. That statute provides\\n for disclosure if the parties consent or if a \"court determines that such tes-\\n timony or disclosure is necessary to - - (A) prevent manifest injustice; (B)\\n help establish a violation of law; or (C) prevent harm to the public health or\\n safety.\\'72\\n With respect to consent - which no court to my knowledge has ad-\\n dressed - an employee or regulated party\\'s relationship to an ombud ar-\\n guably differs materially from that in the attorney-client or physician-\\n patient privilege context. In contrast to clients and patients, those consult-\\n ing agency ombuds do not hire ombuds and have no choice about the om-\\n bud to select.73 Although ombuds may pledge confidentiality to commu-\\n nicants, they owe a duty of loyalty to the agency as well, like the\\n investigator in Weber Aircraft. Confidentiality may attach to the office and\\n not merely to the communicant.\\n Consider that many ombuds resolve complaints and investigate problems\\n by interviewing not just the communicant but others involved as well, in-\\n cluding agency management. An ombud\\'s report may contain more than\\n just documentation of an employee or private party\\'s concerns, and an om-\\n bud\\'s testimony may well reveal more than what the employee or private\\n party initially reported. An individual\\'s waiver certainly should not extend\\n beyond matters directly communicated to the ombud.\\n To be sure, if the waiver were limited to any documentation or recollec-\\n tion of the matters discussed between the ombud and communicant, there\\n likely would not be anything disclosed damaging to the office\\'s reputation.\\n Individuals clearly may disclose the fact they contacted an agency ombud\\n and the contents of any conversations. Authorizing an ombud to withhold\\n documentation of such meetings or to refrain from testifying may not con-\\n tribute that much to the perceived independence of the office. Information\\n would only be disclosed at the behest of the communicant. The same is\\n true for individuals placing trust in physicians or attorneys.\\n 172. 5 U.S.C. § 574(a)(4) (1994).\\n 173. Clients and patients maintain control of records and can waive the privilege. For\\n instance, patients may wish to introduce medical records in a social security disability pro-\\n ceeding, and criminal defendants may seek to introduce a trial attorney\\'s records to demon-\\n strate ineffective assistance of counsel.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n Yet, if the privilege were waivable by the communicant, ombuds\\' efforts\\n on behalf of the agency could be compromised. The ability of ombuds to\\n function independently of both the communicant and management hinges\\n -  at least to a certain degree -  on shielding documentation from all pry-\\n ing eyes. A little disclosure, in other words, may be a dangerous thing.\\n And, as a practical matter, it may be difficult to disclose recollections of\\n discussions with individuals without revealing additional information about\\n follow-up steps.74  As a prophylactic measure, therefore, precluding\\n waiver may enhance the effectiveness of the office.75 Not surprisingly,\\n ombud organizations themselves strenuously have rejected the option of\\n waiver. 176 Therefore, the waiver provision in the ADRA should not be car-\\n ried over to the ombud context.\\n ADRA\\'s other limitations are more relevant. The manifest injustice lan-\\n guage, though vague, establishes a helpful loophole. Without listing all\\n circumstances that might arise, this exception recognizes that courts might\\n wish to order disclosure of documents or testimony in rare situations. For\\n instance, if an ombud were involved in litigation with the employee, disclo-\\n sure of some documents might be in order, whether in litigation or pursuant\\n to a FOIA request.177 Attorneys similarly cannot claim any privilege when\\n the dispute covers their prior representation of a client. Or, because other\\n documents were destroyed, a plaintiff may have no other way to demon-\\n strate the point at which harassment started absent records provided by an\\n ombud. Similarly, documents arguably should be disclosed if probative in\\n a criminal proceeding, as in United States v. Nixon.78 Any such open-\\n ended provision may invite judges to find unusual reasons to order disclo-\\n sure. Nonetheless, some outlet is appropriate to allow judges to compel\\n testimony or order documents disclosed in extremely unusual contexts.\\n 174. For instance, in both Carman and Kientzy, the plaintiffs sought information from\\n the company ombud that would likely reveal more than just the contents of the plaintiffs\\'\\n prior conversation with the ombud. They were most interested in what other employees or\\n management may have disclosed to the ombud. Carman v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 114\\n F.3d 790 (8th Cir. 1997); Kientzy v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 133 F.R.D. 570 (E.D. Mo.\\n 1991).\\n 175. The public interest in ensuring the smooth functioning of agencies arguably makes\\n the case for confidentiality stronger in the public than in the private sector.\\n 176. The Standards of Practice for the Ombudsman Association apparently assert that\\n the office enjoys the privilege (Standards 1.3 and 3.3), as have ombud proponents. See gen-\\n erally Mary P. Rowe, Options, Functions, and Skills: What an Organizational Ombudsman\\n Might Want to Know, I I NEGOTIATION J. 104 (1995).\\n 177. The attorney-client privilege does not apply when the attorney and client take ad-\\n verse positions in litigation.\\n 178. 418 U.S. 683 (1974) (finding that importance of disclosure in a criminal proceeding\\n outweighed presidential communication privilege).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n The \"prevent harm to the public health or safety\" exception protects\\n against future injury. Ombuds should have a duty to disclose information\\n about continuing or future law violations, and they should step forward if\\n they have information about a threatened harm to the public health or\\n safety. Ombuds should counsel communicants that they have a duty to dis-\\n close such information so as not to create unfair surprise. Again, some am-\\n biguity exists as to what constitutes a public health or safety harm, but the\\n gist is that communications to ombuds that reveal such future harm should\\n not remain confidential, and indeed, should be disclosed immediately by\\n the ombud in order to protect individuals and the public more generally.\\n The \"violation of law\" exception, however, is more problematic. On the\\n one hand, it should not be controversial for ombuds to disclose any knowl-\\n edge of continuing law violations, whether rooted in fraud or harassment.\\n Attorneys face a comparable duty.79 Should ombuds be concerned about\\n jeopardizing the confidence of an employee or member of a regulated\\n community, they need only warn them ahead of time - as attorneys should\\n with clients - of this limit on confidentiality.\\n But whether ombuds should also disclose information pertaining to past\\n violations of law is less clear. Many issues brought to an ombud\\'s atten-\\n tion may touch upon some alleged violation of personnel law. Federal per-\\n sonnel rules and regulations cover everything from promotions to smoking\\n at the workplace and from parking privileges to contracting out to the pri-\\n vate sector. Similarly, private parties contacting the ombud may well con-\\n vey information that sheds light on the agency or private party\\'s confor-\\n mance to the intricate rules on procurement. Much of what is raised by an\\n employee or private party in conversations with an ombud may involve a\\n violation of law, however peripheral. The \"violation of law\" exception\\n might swallow the rule if it is construed to encompass any possible in-\\n fringement of a federal rule or violation.\\n 179. See United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 562 (1999). Various ombud organiza-\\n tions have bonded together to draft a model shield law. The exceptions recognized would\\n permit disclosure concerning:\\n a. A felony personally witnessed by the ombudsman or a member of his/her staff or;\\n b. imminent risk of serious harm to an individual {alternative: to public health or\\n safety} which is communicated directly to the ombudsman or a member of his/her\\n staff; or c. the general operation of the ombudsman\\'s office and the general processes\\n employed.\\n Model Shield Law Committee Representing Various Ombudsman Organizations, Model\\n Shield Law for Ombudsman (visited October 27, 1999) . As suggested, such exceptions may be more narrow than neces-\\n sary to retain the appearance of neutrality, and they slight legitimate public needs for the\\n information. See discussion supra Part V.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n In addition, without confidentiality, employees or outsiders who may\\n have committed a relatively minor infraction may hesitate before coming\\n forward. The employee who has photocopied personal papers on company\\n time may decide not to report a more major violation by a co-worker for\\n fear that his comparatively minor misfeasance would be disclosed.\\n An appropriate compromise may well be to limit the \"violation of law\"\\n exception to cover only \"significant violations of law revealing fraud,\\n waste, or abuse.\"\\'180 Pursuant to existing guidelines under the Inspector\\n General Act,\\'8\\' all federal officials currently have a duty to report any evi-\\n dence of fraud, waste or abuse in order to protect the federal fisc. The IG\\n Office in each agency exercises discretion in determining the seriousness of\\n the allegation - not all instances of personal copying should be investi-\\n gated. The \"violation of law\" exception therefore should be modified to\\n cover only \"significant violations of law involving fraud, waste, and\\n abuse.\"\\n No ready accommodation exists between the ombud\\'s interest in confi-\\n dentiality and the public right to know. In attempting that balance, care\\n must be taken that employees and private parties retain incentive to avail\\n themselves of the ombud. At the same time, communications to ombuds\\n would not likely dry up if the ombud ultimately disclosed evidence of con-\\n tinuing law violations or threats to the public safety. As with the attorney-\\n client privilege, a confidential relationship can be maintained even when\\n exceptions exist. Congress should safeguard communications to an ombud\\n but, at the same time, recognize discrete exceptions to sanction disclosure\\n when the public interest is paramount. Thus, in a new statutory scheme,\\n disclosure should be permitted:\\n Only when a court determines that such testimony or records is necessary to (A) pre-\\n vent manifest injustice; or (B) help establish a significant violation of the law in-\\n volving fraud, abuse, or waste; or (C) to prevent harm to the public health or safety.\\n CONCLUSION\\n Confidentiality plays a critical role in encouraging governmental em-\\n ployees and private parties to utilize an agency ombud. Employees and\\n regulated entities may fear reprisals or embarrassment if their contacts with\\n ombuds were disclosed. Conversely, senior agency management may not\\n confide in an ombud if such confidences could later be disclosed in a court\\n proceeding or to any interested employee via a Privacy Act request.\\n 180. Even then, the information allegedly in the ombud\\'s possession should only be dis-\\n closed if other avenues for obtaining the information are not open.\\n 181. Inspector General Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-452, 92 Stat. 1101 (codified at 5\\n U.S.C. app. § 3 (1994)).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n FEDERAL AGENCY OMBUDS\\n \\n Moreover, the stature of the ombud office is tied to its seeming neutrality,\\n and confidentiality enhances that appearance.\\n Nonetheless, confidentiality cannot be guaranteed under the law cur-\\n rently. Ombuds, like other agency officials, must keep and retain all offi-\\n cial agency \"records,\" which include any notes bearing upon the agency\\'s\\n policy and programmatic objectives. Virtually all of the ombud\\'s writings\\n would so qualify. The Archivist may agree to limit any retention period,\\n but prior to disposal, agency records are subject to disclosure upon requests\\n under FOIA and the Privacy Act. Moreover, courts have not uniformly\\n recognized any privilege for ombuds protecting against disclosure in court.\\n Thus, ombuds may have to testify in court proceedings relating to their\\n contacts with the litigants or about matters subject to the litigation.\\n Of the avenues for reform available, a legislatively-enacted privilege\\n holds the most promise. A statute protecting communications to an ombud\\n has the virtue of safeguarding both records and testimony. If the informa-\\n tion sought falls within the privilege, the ombud need not disclose such in-\\n formation whether in response to a FOIA request, request from congres-\\n sional staff, demand from agency management, or court subpoena.\\n At the same time, the legislative privilege need not, and arguably should\\n not, be absolute. Ombuds can expect continued communication from em-\\n ployees and members of regulated entities even if the possibility of disclo-\\n sure exists. For a variety of reasons, employees are likely to confide in an\\n ombud irrespective of the risk of disclosure. They may discount the risk,\\n welcome the risk given that disclosure may ultimately benefit them, or ac-\\n cept the risk given the lack of more palatable alternatives.\\n The political route to reform is difficult, and the question of which ex-\\n ceptions to recognize will not be free from controversy. Modeling the\\n privilege on that afforded under the ADRA may well present the path to\\n least political resistance. Although no waiver provision should be included\\n as under the ADRA, protection for ombud confidentiality similarly should\\n not extend to situations in which the public health or safety is at stake or\\n the information is necessary to help establish a significant violation of law\\n involving fraud, waste, or abuse. In addition, a catchall provision to allow\\n disclosure so as to prevent \"manifest injustice\" should also be applicable,\\n and would likely be relevant only rarely. An exception for all past law\\n violations, however, strikes me as unwise given how expansive that cate-\\n gory can be, and given that so much of the information brought to an om-\\n bud\\'s attention involves an arguable violation of some governmental direc-\\n tive or regulation. Sound legislative policy suggests shielding confidential\\n communications with ombuds while recognizing the overriding public in-\\n terest in ordering disclosure either to prevent future harm or to protect the\\n integrity of the judicial system.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n  ',\n",

It is a good candidate for reversal by\\n the Supreme Court. The issues the ATA court addresses are hardy perenni-\\n als that are worthy of serious analysis independent of the specifics of the\\n case.\\n I have three goals in this Article. First, I will argue that all three judges\\n who comprised the panel succumbed to, and contributed to, what Wendy\\n Wagner calls the \"science charade\" - demanding more of science, and\\n finding more in science, than science can deliver.5 Any decisionmaking\\n standard that purports to be significantly more \"determinate\" and \"binding\"\\n than the standard the EPA applied would be a fraud. Second, I will argue\\n that the remedy adopted by the D.C. Circuit is profoundly antidemocratic.\\n It would either empower judges or a President to make a major policy deci-\\n sion that binds his successors, thereby severely limiting the power of the\\n people to influence policymaking by voting in Presidential elections.\\n Third, I will argue that the degree of indeterminacy that the court found\\n fatal in the EPA\\'s construction of CAA section 109(b) poses no threat to\\n our constitutional structure or values. It is instead symptomatic of a basic\\n characteristic of our political system: Presidential elections matter.\\n Part I provides a descriptive overview of the two rulemakings that the\\n court reviewed. Part II describes the majority and dissenting opinions in\\n ATA. Part III explains the different ways in which the majority and dis-\\n senting opinions fell prey to and contributed to the science charade. Part\\n IV explains why the goals of the majority are unattainable through adoption\\n of any plausible alternative construction of the CAA. Part V explains why\\n the remedy imposed by the court conflicts with our most fundamental con-\\n stitutional value: major policy decisions should be made by institutions that\\n are accountable to the people. Finally, Part VI explains why I am not at all\\n uncomfortable with the legal regime the ATA court found to be fatally\\n flawed. That legal regime allows the people to influence agency policy-\\n making by voting in presidential elections.\\n 3. ATA, 175 F.3d at 1036-37.

THE RULEMAKINGS\\n Numerous petitions to review two rules in which the EPA revised the\\n primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards applicable to\\n ozone and particulate matter precipitated ATA. In the particulate matter\\n rulemaking, the EPA increased the stringency of the annual and twenty-\\n four-hour-primary standards and added new standards applicable to smaller\\n particles.6 There were hundreds of controverted issues in the particulate\\n matter rulemaking. The controversy over competing levels of tolerance of\\n periods in which particulate concentrations exceed the twenty-four-hour-\\n standard illustrates the typical controversy. Many public health authorities\\n urged the EPA to adopt a ninety-ninth percentile measure, while some in-\\n dustry commentators urged the EPA to adopt a ninety-fifth percentile\\n measure.7 However, the EPA adopted a ninety-ninth percentile measure.8\\n In the ozone rulemaking, the EPA increased the stringency of the primary\\n ozone standard from 0.12 to 0.08 ppm (parts per million) and made several\\n changes in the form of the standard.9 There were hundreds of controverted\\n issues in the ozone rulemaking, but much of the controversy focused on the\\n appropriate level of the eight-hour primary ozone standard. Many industry\\n groups urged the EPA to adopt a 0.09 ppm standard, while many environ-\\n mental groups urged the EPA to adopt a 0.07 ppm standard.\\'0 The EPA\\n adopted a 0.08 ppm standard.\"\\n A few general characteristics of the rulemakings will help to put the is-\\n sues in context. The EPA considered over one hundred recent studies of\\n the relationships among particulates, ozone, and human health.\\'2 It re-\\n ceived over one hundred thousand comments on its proposals and on the\\n studies that were the bases for its proposals.\\'3 The EPA devoted thousands\\n 6.

THE JUDICIAL OPINIONS\\n The ATA majority began by describing the applicable statutory regime.\\n For each of 130 criteria pollutants, CAA section 109(b) requires the EPA to\\n set a \"primary standard\" \"requisite to protect the public health\" with an\\n \"adequate margin of safety.\"\\'15 The D.C. Circuit had previously interpreted\\n section 109(b) to authorize the EPA to consider only human health and to\\n forbid it from considering feasibility or cost in setting primary standards.16\\n The majority then held that the EPA\\'s construction of section 109(b)\\n violates the nondelegation doctrine. It is important to follow the majority\\'s\\n idiosyncratic reasoning with respect to the nondelegation doctrine and to\\n understand what it did and did not hold to be unconstitutional. The major-\\n ity did not hold that the language of section 109(b) violates the nondelega-\\n tion doctrine. Such a holding would be indefensible in light of the many\\n less determinate statutory standards the Supreme Court has upheld: \"public\\n interest,\"\\'7 \"public convenience,\"\\'8 \"fair and equitable,\"\\'19 and \"just and\\n reasonable.\"20 The majority also did not find fault in the EPA\\'s choice of\\n decisionmaking criteria. The EPA considers \"severity of effect, certainty\\n of effect, and size of population affected.\",2\\' The majority noted that these\\n criteria were \"long ago approved by the judiciary;\" they \"focus the inquiry\\n on pollution\\'s effects on public health;\" and they \"pose no inherent non-\\n delegation problem.22\\n The majority detected one fatal flaw in the EPA\\'s construction of the\\n statute, however. According to the majority, the \"EPA lacks ... any de-\\n terminate criterion for drawing lines.23 The majority illustrated this point\\n 14. The statements of basis and purpose occupy 244 pages of the Federal Register and\\n incorporate by reference the lengthy analyses contained in the Notices of Proposed Rule-\\n making, the Criteria Documents, the Advisory Committee reports and recommendations,\\n and the Staff Reports.

In defending the deci-\\n sion not to go down to 0.07, EPA never contradicts the intuitive proposition, con-\\n firmed by data in its Staff Paper, that reducing the standard to that level would bring\\n about comparable changes.24\\n The majority then reasoned that the EPA\\'s construction violates the\\n nondelegation doctrine by conferring on the EPA impermissibly broad dis-\\n cretion to decide \"how much is too much.,25 According to the majority,\\n the \"EPA\\'s formulation of its policy judgment leaves it free to pick any\\n point between zero and a hair below the concentrations yielding London\\'s\\n Killer Fog.,26\\n The majority then turned to the question of the appropriate remedy for\\n the EPA\\'s unconstitutional statutory construction. The majority declined to\\n hold that the statute itself is invalid, partly because such a holding is pre-\\n cluded by Supreme Court precedents and partly because of the majority\\'s\\n belief that a constitutional construction of section 109(b) \"is or may be\\n available.27 Instead it remanded the proceeding to the EPA with instruc-\\n tions that the EPA adopt \"determinate, binding standards.\"28 The majority\\n recognized that this remedy does not respond to a \"key function of [the]\\n nondelegation doctrine, to ensure.., that important choices of social pol-\\n icy are made by Congress ... .,,29 The majority ascribed two other valu-\\n able functions to its remedy, however, it will limit agency discretion, and it\\n will provide a basis for judicial review of agency exercises of discretion.3°\\n In order to serve those functions, it seems obvious that the construction\\n must bind the agency for the indefinite future. The majority then suggested\\n potential \"determinate, binding standards\" the EPA might adopt on re-\\n mand.\\'\\n The dissenting judge referred to the many circuit court decisions that\\n have upheld and applied CAA section 109(b) and to the many Supreme\\n Court decisions that have upheld delegations much less determinate than\\n section 109(b).  He also adopted a different interpretation of the EPA\\'s\\n 24. Id. at 1035.\\n 25. Id. at 1034.\\n 26. Id. at 1037.\\n 27. ATA, 175 F.3d at 1038.\\n 28.  Id.\\n 29. Id.\\n 30.

Like the majority, the dissent illustrated his point\\n with reference to the EPA\\'s choice of 0.08 ppm, rather than 0.09 or 0.07, as\\n the eight-hour ozone standard.33 According to the dissenting judge, the\\n EPA based its choice of 0.08 ppm, not on differences in degrees of harm to\\n human health, but on differences in kinds of harm to human health.34\\n In the next section I argue that both opinions in ATA are symptomatic of\\n what Wendy Wagner calls the science charade, demanding more from sci-\\n ence than it can deliver and finding more in science than is there.3\" Before\\n I begin that discussion, it is important to recognize the hyperbole in the\\n majority opinion. The majority says that the EPA is \"free to pick any point\\n between zero and a hair below the concentrations yielding London\\'s Killer\\n Fog.,36 That assertion is a gross exaggeration. Three data points illustrate\\n the extreme hyperbole in the court\\'s description of the upper boundary of\\n the EPA\\'s discretion. First, the London Killer Fog of 1952 is believed to\\n have killed about four thousand people per week.37 Second, those cata-\\n strophic consequences of air pollution resulted from concentration levels\\n approximately fifty times the maximum levels permitted by the particulate\\n and ozone standards in effect before the EPA conducted the rulemakings at\\n issue.38 Third, numerous studies completed after the EPA set the prior\\n standards found that concentrations of ozone and particulates below the\\n prior standards produce health effects more severe and more widespread\\n than the EPA had reason to believe when it set the prior standards.39 Thus,\\n in order to defend a decision to set new standards that are \"a hair below the\\n concentrations yielding London\\'s Killer Fog,\" the EPA would have to say\\n something to the effect of:\\n In light of the new evidence that suggests more severe health effects than\\n we previously believed to result from ozone and particulates in concentra-\\n tions lower than the ceilings we previously established, we hereby increase\\n fifty-fold the primary ozone and particulate standards and permit concen-\\n trations that we estimate will produce 3,900 deaths per week, a mere\\n 202,800 deaths per year. We conclude that these new, relaxed standards\\n that allow greater pollution than the United States has ever experienced\\n 33. See ATA, 175 F.3d at 1058 (Tatel, J., dissenting).\\n 34.

Scientific uncertainty imposes\\n significant limits on the practical ability of courts to review agency policy\\n decisions, but courts are not quite as impotent as the ATA majority asserts.\\n Of course, no agency would make such an absurd decision anyway.\\n The majority\\'s description of the bottom of the EPA\\'s range of discre-\\n tion may be accurate, however. The language of section 109(b) is suscep-\\n tible to a plausible interpretation that would authorize the EPA to set stan-\\n dards that produce zero deaths attributable to criteria pollutants,40 and the\\n available data can support a finding that only zero concentrations of ozone\\n and particulates will avoid all loss of life caused by ozone or particulates.4\\'\\n The EPA has the discretion to choose a zero level of permissible concen-\\n tration, however, only if courts are the sole source of limits on the EPA\\'s\\n discretion. They are not. As I argue in Parts IV and VI, the President is a\\n far more important source of constraints on agency discretion. No Presi-\\n dent would seriously consider allowing the EPA to set primary ozone and\\n particulate standards at zero. As the ATA majority recognized, standards\\n set at a concentration of zero would require complete de-industrialization\\n plus implementation of programs to remove all nonanthropogenic sources\\n of particulates and ozone.42 A zero standard is almost certainly unattain-\\n able, and no President would seriously consider adoption of a standard that\\n even approaches zero. Even an ozone standard of 0.07 ppm would require\\n complete elimination of all anthropogenic sources of ozone in some loca-\\n tions at certain times.43\\n Once you add the President to the courts as a source of constraint on\\n agency discretion, the EPA\\'s range of discretion in the ozone context is\\n 40. Indeed that seems to be the most plausible interpretation of \"requisite to the public\\n health\" with an \"adequate margin for safety.\"\\n 41. The EPA repeatedly referred to all of the adverse health effects of particulates and\\n ozone, including deaths, as lying along a \"continuum\" with no \"discernible threshold\" be-\\n low which the pollutants have no adverse health effects. See generally Particulate Matter\\n Standards, 62 Fed. Reg. at 38,652 (discussing adverse health consequences of different con-\\n centrations of particulates and difficulty in determining appropriate threshold level); Ozone\\n Standards, 62 Fed. Reg. at 38,863 (noting adverse health consequences of different concen-\\n trations of ozone).\\n 42. See ATA, 175 F.3d at 1038 n.4.\\n 43. There are times and places where ozone concentrations exceed 0.07 ppm solely as a\\n result of nonanthropogenic sources. Id. at 1036. High proportions of ozone and particulates\\n have their origin in nonanthropogenic sources. Thus, for instance, up to half of the particu-\\n lates in the air in Florida originate in nonanthropogenic sources in Africa. See Science\\n Notebook, A Breath of Africa in Miami, WASH. POST, July 19, 1999, at A9.\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n probably no greater than 0.07 to 0.10 ppm, given present technology and\\n our present understanding of the relationship between ozone and human\\n health. Obviously, President Clinton was willing to acquiesce in a 0.08\\n ppm standard. It is fair to infer that he would not have been willing to ac-\\n quiesce in a standard of 0.07 or 0.09 ppm.44 It is quite possible that hypo-\\n thetical future President Gore would be willing to acquiesce in a 0.07 or\\n 0.075 ppm standard, given his well-publicized views on the environment.45\\n It is also quite possible that hypothetical future President George W. Bush\\n would be willing to acquiesce in a standard of 0.09, or perhaps even 0.10\\n ppm. That may be the \"compassionate conservative\" ozone standard. I\\n doubt that anyone who would have any chance of being elected President\\n would be willing to acquiesce in a standard below 0.07 or above 0.10 ppm.\\n A standard below 0.07 ppm would be too expensive in dollars for any poli-\\n tician to tolerate, while a standard above 0.10 would be too expensive in\\n lives for any politician to tolerate.46 It is notable that no member of the\\n large and diverse EPA Ozone Advisory Committee urged the adoption of a\\n standard outside the range of 0.08 to 0.10 ppm,47 and no commentor urged\\n adoption of a standard outside the range of 0.07 to 0.12 ppm.48\\n I do not want to minimize the difference between 0.07 and 0.10 ppm.\\n As I discuss in Parts III and IV, that difference can be restated in the form\\n of many thousands of lives and many billions of dollars each year. Thus,\\n the EPA (or more accurately, the President) has substantial policymaking\\n discretion under its own construction of the statute. It is preposterous,\\n however, to assert that either the EPA or the President have the discretion\\n to choose any standard \"between zero and a hair below the concentrations\\n yielding London\\'s Killer Fog.\" That would be true only if you assume\\n both that a court would uphold an EPA decision that increases the permis-\\n sible concentrations of ozones and particulates fifty-fold and that EPA ad-\\n ministrators and/or United States Presidents have a preference for commit-\\n ting political suicide.\\n III.

As Wagner shows, the science charade\\n manifests itself in many ways that distort decisionmaking and render it dif-\\n ficult for anyone to understand how any health-related decision is made.5\\'\\n Thus, for instance, scientists and agencies routinely disguise the important\\n value judgments and massive uncertainties that are inherent in all health-\\n related regulatory decisions.52\\n We, the people, are the ultimate source of the science charade. We have\\n a powerful antipathy toward ambiguity and a deep faith in science to re-\\n solve all important disputes about human health.53 This powerful set of\\n feelings and beliefs is magnified in the context of regulation of toxic risks.\\n We will not tolerate either a decision that creates an avoidable risk of loss\\n of life or a decision to spend large sums of money to avoid uncertain public\\n health risks.54 In short, we will not tolerate either uncertainties or tradeoffs\\n in the context of regulation of toxic risks. Not surprisingly, our agents in\\n government mirror our feelings and beliefs and translate them into statutes\\n and judicial decisions.55\\n There is a problem, however. The field of toxic risk regulation is char-\\n acterized both by the need to make tradeoffs between lives and dollars, and\\n 49. Wagner, supra note 5.

American\\n Petroleum Institute, popularly known as Benzene. 58 The case involved an\\n agency conclusion that it is impossible to determine the level of exposure at\\n which a substance that is known to induce cancer in humans at high expo-\\n sure levels begins to induce cancer in humans at lower exposure levels.59\\n That is not a controversial conclusion in the scientific community.60 Yet,\\n when the agency confronted the Supreme Court with that regrettable limit\\n on the capability of science, a four-Justice plurality simply ordered the\\n agency to do the impossible.61 The plurality went on to demonstrate the\\n Justices\\' abysmal ignorance of elementary toxicology by providing hypo-\\n thetical illustrations of large and small risks that have amused and bewil-\\n dered scientists ever since.62 In describing the hypothetical small and large\\n risks, the Justices omitted data that are crucial in assessing toxic risks.3\\n 56.

It is usually impossible to determine directly whether exposure to low levels of a\\n toxin causes serious harm. It is often easy to determine that exposure to higher levels causes\\n serious harm, however. It would be possible to extrapolate the effects of lower levels if we\\n knew the shape of the dose-response curve. In most cases, however, it is impossible to\\n know the shape of the dose-response curve.\\n 61. See Benzene, 448 U.S. at 639-41 (ordering agency to determine exposure level at\\n which a toxin creates a \"significant risk\" and issue \"standards that are reasonably calculated\\n to produce a safer or more healthy work environment\" even when science makes task im-\\n practicable).\\n 62. The Court said:\\n Some risks are plainly acceptable and others are plainly unacceptable. If, for exam-\\n ple, the odds are one in a billion that a person will die from cancer by taking a drink\\n of chlorinated water, the risk clearly could not be considered significant. On the\\n other hand, if the odds are one in a thousand that regular inhalation of gasoline vapors\\n that are 2% benzene will be fatal, a reasonable person might well consider the risk\\n significant and take appropriate steps to decrease or eliminate it.\\n Id. at 655.\\n 63. The Justices did not describe the size of the exposed population, the duration of\\n exposure, or the shape of the dose-response curve.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n 2000]      JUDICIAL CONTROL OF AGENCY DISCRETION                        73\\n Moreover, the risk the Justices characterized as \"plainly acceptable\" proba-\\n bly exceeds the risk they characterized as \"plainly unacceptable.\"64\\n The ATA case is laced with symptoms of the science charade. The lan-\\n guage of section 109(b) provides a good starting point. Congress required\\n the EPA to establish a primary standard for each criteria pollutant at a level\\n \"requisite to protect the public health\" with an \"adequate margin of safety\"\\n and a secondary standard \"requisite to public welfare.\" The decisionmak-\\n ing standard applicable to primary standards is a good illustration of health\\n and safety absolutism, as it suggests strongly that the EPA is required to\\n protect public health at all costs. Every court that has addressed the ques-\\n tion has reached the conclusion that the EPA is prohibited from considering\\n either cost or feasibility in setting primary standards.65\\n Taken literally, the language of section 109(b) also seems to require the\\n EPA to set primary standards somewhat below the level at which a pollut-\\n ant is likely to kill people. Congress believed that the EPA could (I) de-\\n termine through the use of science the concentration of any pollutant at\\n which the pollutant does not kill anyone; (2) set the primary standard a bit\\n below that level; and, (3) set a still lower secondary standard that would\\n avoid other forms of harm, for example, reduced visibility. Congress also\\n believed that every area of the country could meet the primary standard ap-\\n plicable to each pollutant by 1987, as it mandated that result by statute in\\n 1977.66\\n At least in the cases of particulates and ozone, each of Congress\\'s beliefs\\n is false. The EPA cannot use science to determine a concentration of par-\\n ticulates and ozone that does not kill some people. Science can only pro-\\n vide rough estimates of the correlation between levels of pollutants and ad-\\n verse public health effects, including death. Moreover, the best evidence\\n 64. Using plausible assumptions - an average of 10 drinks of water per day by a\\n population of 260 million over an average life span of 75 years and a linear dose-response\\n curve - the risk the Justices characterized as \"plainly acceptable\" would kill 71,175 people\\n over 75 years, which breaks down to 949 people per year. [0.000000001 x 260,000,000 x\\n 10 x 365 x 75 = 71,175]. It is much more difficult to make a rough estimate of the number\\n of people who would die as a result of the risk the Justices characterized as \"plainly unac-\\n ceptable.\" How many people \"regularly inhale\" gasoline vapors? With self-service gas sta-\\n tions everywhere in the United States except New Jersey and Oregon, I would guess that\\n only about ten thousand people fall in this category. Thus, if I am correct, the \"plainly un-\\n acceptable\" risk would kill about ten people, which is a tiny fraction of the number that\\n would be killed by the \"plainly acceptable\" risk.\\n 65.

Cir. 1999)\\n (commenting many areas are far from attaining mandated standards).\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRA TIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n available suggests strongly that the relationship between concentration and\\n health effects lies on a continuum and that there is no level at which these\\n two pollutants do not kill some people.67 Thus, if the EPA applied the two-\\n step absolute health criterion suggested by a literal reading of section\\n 109(b), it would have to set primary ozone and particulate standards at\\n something like minus 0.2 ppm to zero to satisfy the \"requisite to protect the\\n public health\" criterion, minus 0.2 ppm to provide \"an adequate margin of\\n safety.\" That would be absurd, of course.\\n The EPA salvaged this incoherent statutory standard by finding ambigu-\\n ity in the term \"public health.\" It rejected an interpretation of \"public\\n health\" that would equate the term with freedom from the risk of death at-\\n tributable to pollution, and it interpreted section 109(b) to allow it to take\\n an \"integrative approach\" in setting primary standards, rather than the two-\\n step approach that section seems to require.68 The courts acquiesced in the\\n EPA\\'s creative interpretation.69 In the case of ozone and particulates, the\\n EPA also implicitly interpreted \"protect the public health\" with \"an ade-\\n quate margin of safety\" to be consistent with thousands of deaths per year.\\n Even if every area of the country were in compliance with the new primary\\n standards the court struck down in ATA, the best scientific evidence avail-\\n able suggests that ozone and particulates would continue to kill several\\n thousand people per year.70\\n The EPA\\'s interpretation stretches the statutory language near or per-\\n haps beyond the breaking point. Yet, I find it hard to criticize the EPA. An\\n agency has no choice but to engage in disingenuous reasoning when Con-\\n gress or a court requires it to do the impossible, as both institutions do with\\n considerable frequency in the context of regulation of toxic risks. This\\n background information goes a long way toward explaining the problem\\n the ATA majority identified and attempted to correct.

The dissenting judge would have upheld the EPA\\'s\\n choice of standards because he interpreted the EPA as having drawn a line\\n based on differences in kind, rather than differences in degree, of adverse\\n health effects.71 He cited passages in the EPA statements of basis and pur-\\n pose to support that interpretation. Thus, for instance, the EPA explained\\n its choice of ozone standards on the basis that \"[t]he most certain [ozone-]\\n related effects, while judged to be adverse, are transient and reversible.72\\n The dissenting judge interpreted that statement as proof that the EPA drew\\n the line between permanent and irreversible effects, and transitory and re-\\n versible effects, and/or between certain and uncertain effects. That inter-\\n pretation is demonstrably false, but it is a typical judicial symptom of the\\n science charade. We want science to provide clear answers to all important\\n questions, so we find scientific answers where they do not and cannot exist.\\n The EPA statement the dissenting judge relied on may be technically ac-\\n curate, but it is seriously misleading. Indeed, it was almost certainly in-\\n cluded in the agency\\'s statement of basis and purpose in an attempt to\\n mislead a reviewing court. The statement is yet another symptom of the\\n science charade. Since Congress and courts insist that agencies defend\\n their decisions as objective applications of science, an agency must use\\n words that mislead a court into thinking that is what it has done.\\n If you parse the words the dissenting opinion quotes, and consider those\\n words in the context of the several thousand pages in which the EPA ex-\\n plains the basis for its actions, it is easy to spot the dissenting judge\\'s inter-\\n pretive error. Two features of the EPA\\'s explanation are sufficient alone to\\n demonstrate the judge\\'s error. First, the EPA predicted that even compli-\\n ance with the new primary standards is likely to produce several thousand\\n 73\\n deaths per year attributable to ozone and particulates.  Death is not a\\n \"transient and reversible\" effect, so the EPA could not have meant to say\\n that the health effects below 0.08 ppm are \"transient and reversible.\" It\\n said only that the most \"certain\" effects are \"transient and reversible.\"\\n Thus, for instance at 0.08 ppm, non-fatal incidents of pulmonary distress\\n are more certain than death, but that is also true at every other level. Sec-\\n ond, the EPA repeatedly referred to the health effects of ozone and par-\\n ticulates as lying on a \"continuum,\" a relationship that is confirmed by\\n looking at the EPA tables that show the estimated correlation between con-\\n 71.

Reg. at 38,856; RIA, supra note 67.\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n centration levels and health effects.74 The EPA predicted only differences\\n in degrees of health effects, not differences in kinds of effects. The esti-\\n mated number of deaths varies with the concentration level, but the EPA\\n predicted some deaths at each level it considered, including the level it\\n chose. Of course, the degree of certainty of deaths increases from the 0.08\\n ppm level to the 0.09 ppm level, but it also increases at every other level.\\n At this point, it is useful to describe briefly the manner in which the EPA\\n (or anyone else) attempts to estimate the health consequences of exposure\\n to toxic substances, and the massive range of uncertainty that surrounds all\\n such estimates. The EPA begins with studies that \"find\" particular rela-\\n tionships between different levels of exposure and various health effects.\\n In the ozone and particulate rulemakings, the EPA considered over one\\n hundred epidemiological and human clinical studies that had been pub-\\n lished since it last changed the primary standards.\" Each study looked at a\\n different population that was exposed to different concentrations of pollut-\\n ants for different periods of time. Some were \"negative effects\" studies,76\\n for example, they found no statistically significant difference in health ef-\\n fects of exposure to the different concentrations that were studied. Most\\n found statistically significant differential effects, however, and most found\\n adverse effects, including deaths, at levels well below the pre-existing pri-\\n mary standards.77 The studies varied greatly, however, with respect to the\\n magnitude of both the absolute effects and the differential effects of expo-\\n sures to the concentrations studied. Each study was imperfect in important\\n respects. For example, the researchers could not definitively exclude the\\n potential effects of other variables, and the findings of each study were\\n qualified with reference to wide ranges of uncertainty attributable to vari-\\n ables such as sample size.\\n Each study was critiqued in detail in the over one hundred thousand\\n comments. The EPA responded to those critiques and explained why it at-\\n tached greater significance to some studies than to others. The EPA em-\\n phasized repeatedly that it \"places greater weight on the overall conclu-\\n sions derived from the studies . . . than on the specific concentration-\\n response functions and quantitative risk derived from them\" because of the\\n 74.

The process of risk assessment involves ex-\\n tracting findings from various studies, attaching differential weights to\\n those findings based on an evaluation of the likely level of validity as-\\n signed to each, and then applying a variety of statistical techniques to ob-\\n tain estimates of the likely adverse health effects of exposures to the con-\\n centrations under consideration. Thus, for instance, the EPA estimated that\\n retention of the pre-existing ozone and particulate standards, rather than\\n adoption of the new standards, would produce between 3,300 and 17,900\\n deaths per year.79 To its credit, the EPA emphasized repeatedly the uncer-\\n tainties that affect all such estimates, but it was not completely candid in\\n disclosing the full magnitude of those uncertainties. As Howard Latin and\\n Tom McGarity have shown, \"the estimates provided by existing risk as-\\n sessment models could vary million-fold, depending upon the model se-\\n lected.\"80 Albert Nichols and Richard Zeckhauser explain how different\\n choices of plausible values for each of only three of the many factors that\\n are used in a risk assessment cause the resultiiig estimates to vary \"by a\\n factor of 35,000.\"48\\n The EPA was less than fully candid in another respect as well. It did not\\n make explicit findings with respect to the differential effects of alternative\\n concentrations on the number of deaths caused by pollution, for example, it\\n did not estimate the number of additional deaths that could be avoided by\\n adopting an ozone standard of 0.07, rather than 0.08 ppm. It is easy to infer\\n such an estimate from analysis of the EPA\\'s risk assessment, however.\\n EPA\\'s Advisory Committee noted that the data gathered and evaluated by\\n the EPA show a \"continuum of biological responses down to background\\n [nonanthropogenic source] concentrations\"82 and no \"bright line\" that dis-\\n tinguishes the differential effects of any pair of alternative concentrations.83\\n 78.

In both cases, of course, the estimates\\n would be subject to a massive range of uncertainty.\\n It follows that the ATA majority was correct in concluding that the\\n EPA\\'s construction of section 109(b) provides the EPA, and reviewing\\n courts, no \"determinate, binding standard\" that can be used as the basis for\\n choosing a primary ozone standard, at least within the range of 0.00 to 0.12\\n ppm.84 At this point, the sources of the ATA majority\\'s concerns become\\n apparent. If the EPA chose zero concentration standards, it would shut\\n down the entire economy.85 If it chose to retain the existing standards, it\\n would be accepting the death of about 20,000 people per year.86 Even the\\n choice it made to increase the stringency of the standards a bit required it to\\n choose between saving an additional 10,000 or so lives per year and\\n avoiding additional costs of about fifty-billion dollars a year.87 This seems\\n like an enormous amount of policymaking discretion to confer on someone\\n Chief Justice Rehnquist has referred to as a \"politically unresponsive ad-\\n ministrator[s].\"88 Moreover, the D.C.

The majority holds that the EPA\\'s construction of section 109(b)\\n is unconstitutional and that the EPA cannot take any actions to implement\\n that section until it adopts a new construction that includes determinate,\\n binding standards that the EPA and courts can use to determine \"how much\\n [pollution] is too much.,89 This is the point at which the majority fell prey\\n to the science charade. It assigned the EPA a task that the EPA cannot per-\\n form. Indeed, no institution can perform that task.\\n 84. See ATA, 175 F.3d 1027, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\\n 85. See id. at 1038 n.4.\\n 86.

ALTERNATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT\\n In this section, I will evaluate four potential alternative constructions of\\n section 109(b) that might appear to comply with the court\\'s mandate. Be-\\n fore I begin that task, however, it is important to recognize that the general\\n problem identified by the ATA majority is ubiquitous. We have tens of\\n thousands of statutory and regulatory provisions that use numbers to draw\\n critical distinctions. In a high proportion of cases, the line-drawing process\\n that produced those numbers is indistinguishable from the process the EPA\\n used to set the ozone standard at 0.08, rather than 0.07 or 0.09 ppm. Yet,\\n the Republic has not fallen.\\n Two readily accessible numbers illustrate the point. You must be eight-\\n een to vote and twenty-one to buy alcohol in the United States. In both\\n cases, the line-drawing is based on maturity, but everyone knows that ma-\\n turity does not arrive as a birthday present on either your eighteenth or\\n twenty-first birthday. Maturation is a process that is both gradual and vari-\\n able. Like the health effects of ozone and particulates, the correlation be-\\n tween age and maturity lies on a continuum with approximately equal in-\\n tervals separating eighteen year olds from nineteen year olds, nineteen year\\n olds from twenty year olds, and twenty year olds from twenty-one year\\n olds. We could as easily defend decisions to make twenty-one the mini-\\n mum age for voting and eighteen the minimum age for drinking. Indeed,\\n many states had minimum drinking ages below twenty-one until Congress\\n effectively forced them to adopt twenty-one as the minimum age, and\\n twenty-one was the minimum voting age until Congress changed it to\\n eighteen a couple of decades ago.\\n Of course, those necessarily arbitrary exercises in line-drawing were per-\\n formed by Congress, thereby avoiding both potential attacks under the\\n nondelegation doctrine and the concerns that underlie the nondelegation\\n doctrine. But Congress cannot possibly make all of the line-drawing deci-\\n sions that have produced tens of thousands of legally operative numbers in\\n the Code of Federal Regulations. The counter-argument voiced by some is\\n that Congress at least can make the few \"fundamental\" policy decisions\\n that agencies now make every year.90 The EPA\\'s ozone and particulate\\n rules would seem to fall in that category. They require some institution to\\n make tradeoffs between sacrificing about 10,000 lives per year and spend-\\n ing about fifty billion dollars a year in additional pollution control costs.91\\n 90. See Benzene, 448 U.S. at 687 (Rehnquist, J., concurring) (stating \"when funda-\\n mental policy decisions underlying legislation ... are to be made, the buck stops with Con-\\n gress and the President\").\\n 91. See RIA, supra note 67, at ES-17 to -20.\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n The argument that Congress should make all \"fundamental policy deci-\\n sions\" sounds good in theory, but it collapses completely upon considera-\\n tion of the institutional limitations of Congress. As I have argued else-\\n where, Congress is plagued by a combination of characteristics that render\\n it totally unsuited to the task of drawing quantitative lines in the context of\\n toxic risk regulation.92  Those characteristics include inadequate knowl-\\n edge, inadequate foresight, inadequate expertise, and a host of severe col-\\n lective action problems. Congress rarely chooses to use numbers when it\\n enacts regulatory legislation. On the rare occasions when it has chosen to\\n act in that manner, the results have been disastrous.93 I certainly do not\\n want to tell Congress that it must act in that manner. I do not want to de-\\n mand that the same institution that produced the absurdly unrealistic lan-\\n guage of CAA section 109(b) must establish quantitative standards appli-\\n cable to each of 130 criteria pollutants.\\n A. Cost-Benefit Analysis\\n I will begin by evaluating an alternative construction of section 109(b)\\n that the ATA majority did not urge the EPA to consider. The ATA court\\n could not urge the EPA to adopt a construction that permits, or requires,\\n cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The D.C. Circuit has interpreted section\\n 109(b) to preclude consideration of costs, and a panel of the D.C. Circuit is\\n required to adhere to decisions issued by other panels.94 There is no doubt,\\n 92.

Both\\n judges are economically oriented former academics who were appointed by\\n President Reagan,95 and the author of the opinion has urged agency use of\\n CBA in similar contexts.96 In fact, in all likelihood, the judges who com-\\n prised the ATA majority were motivated in part by their desire to create a\\n vehicle through which the en banc circuit will have the opportunity to re-\\n consider, and potentially to overrule, the 1980 panel decision that held that\\n the EPA cannot consider costs in implementing section 109(b).97 It is an\\n interesting irony that the excessive discretion that the ATA majority found\\n was attributable in part to a prior judicial decision that had the putative ef-\\n fect of limiting the EPA\\'s discretion.\\n Contrary to the apparent belief of the ATA majority, CBA has little, if\\n any, potential value to a reviewing court as a means of limiting agency dis-\\n cretion. Indeed, a CBA is likely to be useful to a court only as a modest\\n source of reassurance that the agency has chosen one of countless standards\\n that fall within the massive range of overlap between plausible estimates of\\n the costs and benefits of alternative standards. CBA cannot provide an\\n \"objective\" estimate of costs and benefits because its results depend criti-\\n cally on value judgments made by the analyst. CBA also cannot provide a\\n \"determinate\" standard because it is capable of producing only extraordi-\\n narily broad ranges of estimates of costs and benefits. Agency rules almost\\n always have the potential to create a wide range of estimated benefits that\\n overlaps significantly with a wide range of estimated costs. Lisa Heinzer-\\n (citing Lead Indus.

In 1986,\\n John Morrall, an economist at the Office of Management and Budget, used\\n the second method to summarize the results of CBAs he had performed of\\n forty-four federal health and safety rules.99 According to Morrall\\'s table,\\n twenty-four of those rules required the incurring of compliance costs in ex-\\n cess of seven million dollars per life saved, the high end of the range of\\n economists\\' estimates of the value we place on reducing risks to our\\n lives.00 Morrall listed thirteen rules with estimated costs per life saved in\\n excess of one hundred million dollars and three rules with estimated costs\\n per life saved in excess of a billion dollars.\\'0\\' Morrall provided only a lim-\\n ited description of the methodology he used to create his table and none of\\n the data he used for that purpose. Over the next twenty-two years, scores\\n of scholars and witnesses before congressional Committees quoted the\\n Morrall table uncritically to support the proposition that federal regulatory\\n agencies often act irrationally by issuing many rules that require society to\\n incur costs that vastly exceed benefits.02 Lisa Heinzerling\\'s 1998 article in\\n Yale Law Journal should bring that routine practice to an abrupt halt. More\\n importantly for present purposes, that article demonstrates what Heinzer-\\n ling calls \"the perils of precise quantification\" - a recurring symptom of\\n the science charade.103\\n Heinzerling did what no one else had bothered to do. She obtained all of\\n the data that were the basis for Morrall\\'s estimates. She then used a proc-\\n ess of reverse engineering to identify Morrall\\'s methodology, including the\\n many places where he used a particular number of lives saved from a wide\\n range of estimated lives saved and the many places where he inserted con-\\n testable values into the calculation process. Morrall often ignored all bene-\\n fits except lives saved, even though many of the rules had other significant\\n health and environmental benefits.04 He often chose an estimate of lives\\n 98.

Granting Heinzerling\\'s point that CBA is too indeterminate and value-\\n laden to be useful to a court, I believe that it is entirely appropriate for a politically account-\\n able official, i.e., the president, to make the value judgements inherent in using CBA as a\\n decisionmaking tool. We vote for a presidential candidate because we believe that he shares\\n our values and will apply those values in making policy decisions.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n 2000]     JUDICIAL CONTROL OF AGENCY DISCRETION                   85\\n range of uncertainty inherent in CBA.\" 8 No agency, OMB analyst, wit-\\n ness, or scholar should summarize the results of any CBA with an inher-\\n ently misleading single number or set of numbers, for example, the esti-\\n mated cost per life saved is X, or the estimated costs are Y and the\\n estimated benefits are Z. The results of any CBA should be summarized\\n only in the form of the range of results that can be supported through use of\\n the available data and plausible methodologies. Thus, for instance, the\\n CBA for OSHA\\'s formaldehyde rule should be summarized as producing\\n cost estimates between zero and $72 billion per life saved.\\n Heinzerling\\'s study provides powerful evidence to refute the belief of\\n many that CBA is a useful tool for application by a reviewing court.\\n Heinzerling found only two cases in which a court rejected an agency rule\\n based on the court\\'s application of CBA.\"9 That is not surprising, given\\n the extraordinarily wide range of estimates that alternative CBAs can yield.\\n Scientifically illiterate and politically unaccountable judges are incompe-\\n tent to resolve the science-based, data-based, or value-based disputes that\\n produce CBA estimates that routinely vary by a multiple of over one thou-\\n sand. Thus, an interpretation of CAA section 109(b) that requires the EPA\\n to use CBA in implementing CAA section 109(b) would not satisfy the\\n ATA majority\\'s demand for a \"determinate, binding standard\" that would\\n allow the EPA and reviewing courts \"to state intelligently how much is too\\n much.\"   CBA is far too value-laden and indeterminate to perform that\\n function.\\n I would much prefer an interpretation of section 109(b) that permits the\\n EPA to consider CBA for two other reasons, however. First, I am confi-\\n dent that the EPA did, in fact, consider its CBA of the ozone and particu-\\n late rules, notwithstanding its claims to the contrary.120 The EPA states that\\n it never considers cost in making decisions under section 109(b).121 Yet, it\\n always conducts a CBA before it takes any such action. For instance, the\\n EPA prepared a 718-page CBA of the proposed ozone and particulate\\n rules.122 The EPA says that it prepares a CBA only to aid states in the pro-\\n cess of developing implementation plans, and never considers the CBA in\\n its own decisionmaking.123 Yet, the CBA is available to anyone on the\\n 118. See id. at 2064-70 (considering but rejecting those methods of addressing problem).\\n 119. See Heinzerling, supra note 98, at 2005-08 (discussing Fifth Circuit\\'s invalidation\\n of EPA\\'s ban on asbestos because its costs exceeded its benefits).\\n 120. The EPA\\'s use of CBA in its prior decisionmaking under CAA section 109(b) has\\n been well documented. See Wagner, supra note 5, at 1641-44.\\n 121. See, e.g., Particulate Matter Standards, 62 Fed. Reg. 38,652, 38,701 (1997).\\n 122. See RIA, supra note 67.\\n 123. See Particulate Matter Standards, 62 Fed. Reg. at 38,701.\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n Internet.124 I cannot believe that no one in the White House, the Adminis-\\n trator\\'s office, and the Advisory Committee spent the two minutes neces-\\n sary to obtain access to the CBA, and the half hour necessary to read the\\n twenty-two-page executive summary. If no one in the decisionmaking pro-\\n cess actually considered costs, I cannot imagine how the EPA chose an\\n ozone standard of 0.08 ppm, rather than 0.07, 0.06, etc. It is clear that each\\n reduction in concentration saves lives.\\'25 It follows that any decisionmaker\\n who actually ignores cost and feasibility would choose a lower standard\\n than the EPA chose.\\n The EPA Administrator undoubtedly met with the President at some\\n point during the rulemaking process, to tell him that she was considering\\n taking an action that she thought might save about ten thousand lives per\\n year. No President would acquiesce in a decision of that magnitude with-\\n out first discussing it with the Administrator. I cannot imagine any Presi-\\n dent who would not then ask the Administrator for some estimate of the\\n cost of the action before acquiescing. I also cannot imagine any President\\n who would acquiesce in the Administrator\\'s proposed action if she re-\\n sponded with either: \"I have no clue,\" or \"I think it will require the de-\\n industrialization of the United States.\" (I doubt that President Clinton has\\n forgotten James Carville\\'s famous advice: \"It\\'s the economy, stupid.\")\\n Thus, an interpretation of section 109(b) that allows the EPA to consider\\n costs would further the goal of transparent decisionmaking by allowing the\\n EPA to explain how it used CBA in its decisionmaking process.\\n Second, the ATA court would have found the EPA\\'s CBA reassuring if it\\n had been given access to that document. Using the best available sources\\n of data, plausible assessments of health risks, and defensible value-based\\n methodological assumptions, the EPA estimated that the new rules would\\n cost an estimated $46.6 billion per year and would yield monetary benefits\\n in the range of $21.5 billion to $118 billion per year.26 To its credit, the\\n EPA\\'s CBA repeatedly emphasized the uncertainties inherent in the proc-\\n ess of preparing a CBA. CBA is a useful decisionmaking tool only if the\\n decisionmaker understands the massive range of uncertainties inherent in\\n the process of estimating the costs and benefits of a proposed rule.\\n I have only one serious criticism of the EPA\\'s CBA. By summarizing\\n its cost estimate with a single figure, instead of a wide range,27 and by\\n 124. See id.\\n 125. See id. at 38,688; Ozone Standards, 62 Fed. Reg. 38,856 (1997); RIA, supra note\\n 67.\\n 126. See RIA, supra note 67, at ES-12 to -22.\\n 127. Like Heinzerling, I have emphasized the range of uncertainty that affects benefit\\n estimates. Cost estimates also have wide ranges of uncertainty. The range of uncertainty of\\n the cost of the EPA\\'s ozone and particulate rules is unusually large. The rules would only\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n 2000]      JUDICIAL CONTROL OFAGENCYDISCRETION                             87\\n summarizing its benefits estimate with reference to a relatively narrow\\n range, the EPA also has succumbed to the science charade. It stated the re-\\n sults of its CBA with much greater precision than the underlying science\\n permits. The EPA stated its benefit estimate in the form of a range, but the\\n range it reported is far too small. Given the enormous range of uncertainty\\n apparent in the findings of the one hundred plus epidemiological studies\\n and the wide range of defensible value judgments that the EPA could have\\n used to calculate the estimated benefits of the rules, a competent analyst\\n could easily defend as plausible benefit estimates that are both far below\\n the low end of the range the EPA reported and far above the high end of the\\n range the EPA reported.28 It is also apparent from the underlying data that\\n the EPA could have used CBA to support its choice of any standard be-\\n tween 0.07 and 0.10 ppm.\\'29 Thus, judicial access to the CBA would be of\\n no help whatsoever to a court that wants to be able to limit the EPA\\'s dis-\\n cretion. By contrast, it is helpful to a President because he can use his val-\\n ues as the basis for choosing where to draw the line between protection of\\n public health and costs, given the massive uncertainties inherent in esti-\\n mating both the costs and benefits of alternative standards. In a democ-\\n racy, the President\\'s values are the best available proxy for the values of\\n the people.\\n B. Zero Health Risks\\n After noting that the EPA was precluded from using CBA by the D.C.\\n Circuit\\'s prior opinions, the ATA majority suggested other ways in which\\n require states to take whatever action each considers necessary to attain the new standards.\\n Thus, the analyst had to predict how each state would respond to the new standards and how\\n each source would respond to each new state rule over the next decade or so.\\n 128. The literature on risk assessment and cost-benefit-analysis identifies and illustrates\\n scores of ways in which an analyst\\'s choice of plausible variables and methodologies can\\n yield variations in benefit estimates that vary by a millionfold. See generally Heinzerling,\\n supra note 98, at 2070 (explaining how quantitative risk analysis can harm objectivity of\\n analysis of risk and cost); Latin, supra note 49 (arguing that inadequate scientific knowledge\\n and data often prevent us from obtaining reliable risk assessment); McGarity, supra note 80,\\n at 1403 (suggesting that risk assessment results could vary greatly depending on model se-\\n lected); Nichols & Zeckhauser, supra note 81, at 18 (explaining how assumptions in risk\\n assessment could effect range of results); Wagner, supra note 5, at 1619 (suggesting there\\n are limits to what science can do). Thus, for instance, Morrall might well rely on the find-\\n ings of the several \"negative effects\" studies as the basis for his belief that the ozone and\\n particulate rules would produce no health benefits. Conversely, use of the \"Oregon ap-\\n proach,\" suggested by the A TA majority, would produce benefit estimates far above the up-\\n per end of the range of estimates reported by the EPA. See infra text accompanying notes\\n 143-49.\\n 129. See Particulate Matter Standards, 62 Fed. Reg. at 38,688; Ozone Standards, 62 Fed.\\n Reg. at 38,856; RIA, supra note 67.\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE L4 W REVIEW\\n \\n the EPA might be able to comply with the court\\'s mandate.\\'30 First, the\\n \"EPA could make its criterion the eradication of any hint of direct health\\n risk.\"\\'\\'  The majority recognized that \"[t]his approach is certainly deter-\\n minate enough.\\'32 It also noted, however, that the EPA has shown \"no in-\\n clination to adopt it.\"\\'133 The reasons are obvious. As the majority recog-\\n nizes, a zero health risk criterion could be satisfied only with zero\\n concentrations of ozone and particulates, which in turn could not be at-\\n tained even with complete de-industrialization.34 No one who could be\\n elected President would make that tradeoff between public health and pros-\\n perity. Indeed, public health would not fare well for long in an impover-\\n ished nation.\\n The majority went on to suggest that the EPA might choose a variant of\\n a no adverse health effects criterion. For this purpose, the EPA \"might...\\n use standards drawn from other areas of the law, such as the familiar \\'more\\n probable than not\\' criterion.\\'35 In other words, the EPA could use a crite-\\n rion that requires it to set emissions levels that will eliminate the probabil-\\n ity of adverse health effects. Given the available data on the relationship\\n between human health and exposure to ozone and particulates, this criterion\\n also would require the EPA to set maximum permissible concentrations at\\n levels that cannot be attained even with complete de-industrialization.\\n There is no level of ozone or particulates above zero that does not produce\\n a probability of loss of life.36 It is hard to believe that the two economi-\\n cally-oriented conservative Republican judges who formed the ATA major-\\n ity are seriously urging the EPA to adopt a decisionmaking standard that\\n requires complete de-industrialization. Whatever the majority\\'s agenda\\n may be, that cannot be among its goals.\\n C. The \"Modest Deviation from Stringency\" Criterion\\n The ATA majority suggested another potential constitutional construc-\\n tion of section 109(b) by reference to another agency\\'s constitutionally-\\n permissible construction of a similar statutory provision.37 In 1991, a D.C.\\n 130. See American Trucking Ass\\'ns v. EPA, 175 F.3d 1027, 1038-40 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\\n 131.  Id. at 1038.\\n 132.  Id.\\n 133.  Id.\\n 134. See id.\\n 135.  Id.\\n 136.

See ATA, 175 F.3d at 1037 (discussing 1991 D.C. Circuit case involving Occupa-\\n tional Safety and Health Administration\\'s interpretation of section 3(8) of Occupational\\n Safety and Health Act).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n 2000]     JUDICIAL CONTROL OF AGENCY DISCRETION               89\\n Circuit panel held that the OSHA\\'s construction of section 3(8) of the Oc-\\n cupational Safety and Health Act violated the nondelegation doctrine by\\n providing decisionmaking criteria that were inadequate to limit OSHA\\'s\\n discretion or to provide a basis for judicial review of OSHA actions.138 The\\n author of the majority opinion in ATA wrote that 1991 opinion. The two\\n opinions are almost identical with respect to their holdings, reasoning, and\\n choice of remedies. The only significant difference between the two opin-\\n ions is with respect to the court\\'s treatment of CBA. Since the D.C. Circuit\\n had not previously held that section 3(8) precludes OSHA from using\\n CBA, the court was free to suggest that OSHA adopt a construction of sec-\\n tion 3(8) that requires it to use CBA as a way of complying with the court\\'s\\n mandate to adopt a constitutional construction of section 3(8). The court\\n suggested that OSHA comply with its mandate in that manner.39\\n OSHA rejected the court\\'s suggestion. Instead, it attempted to satisfy\\n the court\\'s mandate by adopting a statutory construction that requires\\n OSHA to issue safety standards that provide \"a high degree of worker pro-\\n tection.\"\\'140 In a 1994 opinion, the same panel held that OSHA\\'s new con-\\n struction satisfied the nondelegation doctrine by precluding the agency\\n from doing \"nothing at all\" once it identifies a significant safety risk.\\'4\\'\\n Presumably, the ATA majority would be equally content with an EPA con-\\n struction of CAA section 109(b) that requires the EPA to issue primary air\\n quality standards that provide a \"high degree of protection\" of the health of\\n people who are exposed to criteria pollutants. After all, both the 1991 and\\n 1994 opinions were written by the same judge who wrote the majority\\n opinion in ATA.\\n I do not understand how the EPA\\'s adoption of a \"high degree of pro-\\n tection\" criteria for applying section 109(b) would have any effect whatso-\\n ever on its degree of discretion in issuing primary air quality standards or\\n on a court\\'s ability to review the EPA actions taken pursuant to section\\n 109(b). That construction seems to be nothing more than a way of para-\\n phrasing the language of section 109(b) and the language the EPA already\\n uses to describe the criteria it uses to apply that section. A decisionmaking\\n standard that requires a \"high\" degree of protection of human health obvi-\\n ously says nothing that is the least bit helpful in deciding how \"high\" is too\\n high or too low. At most, such a standard would preclude the EPA from\\n \"doing nothing at all\" or from issuing ozone and particulate standards that\\n 138. See International Union, UAW v. OSHA, 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C.

Reg. 16,615 (1993) (codified at\\n 29 C.F.R. pt. 1910 (1999)).\\n 141. See International Union, UAW v. OSHA, 37 F.3d 665. 669 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW RE VIEW\\n \\n are \"a hair below the concentrations yielding London\\'s Killer Fog.\" As I\\n demonstrated in Part II, however, the EPA does not have that discretion to-\\n day.\\n The construction that OSHA adopted and the court approved obviously\\n would have no effect on the EPA\\'s discretion to choose any standard at or\\n below the 0.08 ppm standard it chose in its ozone rulemaking. Such a con-\\n struction would limit only the upper end of the agency\\'s range of discre-\\n tion. Thus, if its adoption by the EPA had any effect at all, it would require\\n the EPA to adopt a standard of 0.07 ppm or lower. A 0.07 ppm standard\\n would be much more costly than a 0.08 ppm standard. It would require\\n complete cessation of all industrial and transportation activities in some ar-\\n eas during some periods of time,142 which would result in a partial de-\\n industrialization of the United States. Are two conservative Republican\\n judges really trying to force the Clinton Administration to adopt a con-\\n struction of CAA that requires both President Clinton and all of his succes-\\n sors to impose far more costly air quality rules? I doubt it, but this is a\\n good point to repeat the old cliche: \"Be careful what you ask for. You\\n might get it.\" Hypothetical future President Al Gore might welcome the\\n opportunity to say that he was compelled by the order of two Republican\\n judges to issue more costly air quality rules. Conversely, hypothetical fu-\\n ture President George W. Bush would find it hard to live with a construc-\\n tion of the CAA adopted by the Clinton Administration, under compulsion\\n of an order issued by two Republican judges that requires him to issue rules\\n that are far more costly than he would prefer.\\n D. The \"Generic Unit of Harm\" Criterion\\n The ATA majority went on to suggest that the EPA might adopt a \"ge-\\n neric unit of harm\" criterion \"that takes into account population affected,\\n severity [of harm], and probability [of harm].\\'43 For this purpose, the\\n majority suggested that the EPA might adopt \"the approach Oregon used in\\n devising its health plan for the poor.\\'\\'14 Oregon attached values to various\\n health states by polling a sample of citizens. As the ATA majority noted,\\n however, the Department of Health and Human Services concluded that the\\n Oregon approach violated the Americans with Disabilities Act.45 The ATA\\n majority suggested that the EPA could avoid this problem by relying in part\\n on a poll of asthmatics to determine the values they place on the various\\n 142. See discussion supra note 43.\\n 143. American Trucking Ass\\'ns v. EPA, 175 F.3d 1027, 1039 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\\n 144. Id.\\n 145. See id. n.5.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n 2000]     JUDICIAL CONTROL OFAGENCYDISCRETION                 91\\n states of pulmonary health that correlate with exposure to various concen-\\n trations of ozone and particulates.146\\n At bottom, this suggested construction would require the EPA to use a\\n peculiar version of a CBA. The new version of a CBA would differ from a\\n traditional CBA in three significant ways. First, it would require much\\n more time and person-hours to implement, because it would require ana-\\n lysts to value more health benefits, such as, non-fatal pulmonary distress,\\n hospitalization, etc.147 Second, it would yield a much higher range of esti-\\n mated benefits of a rule that reduces permissible ozone and particulate con-\\n centrations, both because it would place explicit values on more adverse\\n health effects, and because it would reflect the higher values of the most\\n sensitive subset of the population. Third, it would not include any discus-\\n sion or consideration of costs, in order to avoid violation of the D.C. Cir-\\n cuit\\'s prior holding that the EPA cannot consider costs in implementing\\n section 109(b).\\n Like the ATA majority\\'s other suggestions, it is impossible to take the\\n \"generic unit of harm\" suggestion seriously. Its flaws are obvious. It\\n would just provide a different method of describing the situation that the\\n EPA has already found to exist. The EPA has estimated a variety of ad-\\n verse health effects of varying levels of ozone exposure, such as, deaths\\n hospitalizations, and incidents of non fatal pulmonary distress. The court\\n urges the EPA to translate each health effect into a common unit of meas-\\n ure, for example, one death equals four hospitalizations or eight non-fatal\\n incidents of respiratory distress. It is hard to see any benefit from such an\\n exercise. It is simply another symptom of the science charade - requiring\\n the illusion of objectivity and quantitative precision in a context in which\\n science is incapable of providing either.\\n The resulting estimates of generic units of harm at various exposure lev-\\n els would be worthless as a means of deciding \"how much is too much.\"\\n The generic unit of harm table would show exactly the same relationship\\n between concentration and adverse health effects that the EPA has already\\n found to exist. The best data available suggest the existence of a \"contin-\\n uum,\" with no clear break points and no thresholds below which no risks to\\n human health exist.48 The generic unit of harm table would show that\\n same continuum. The table would have to be compared with something\\n else to determine \"how much is too much.\" The only logical comparative\\n frame of reference is cost. Yet, the courts have held that the EPA cannot\\n 146. See id.\\n 147. The EPA did not estimate monetary value of many beneficial effects of new stan-\\n dards.

Finally, even if the EPA could identify some legally-\\n permissible comparative frame of reference - perhaps some cleverly dis-\\n guised surrogate for cost - the result would not comply with the court\\'s\\n mandate. No matter how cleverly it is disguised or how its results are\\n stated, CBA cannot be a \"determinate, binding standard.\" It is premised on\\n a series of highly subjective value judgments and it is subject to massive\\n indeterminacy.49\\n V. THE COURT\\'S REMEDY Is ANTI-DEMOCRATIC\\n The ATA majority was motivated by a concern that has been voiced by\\n many respected jurists and academic commentators. Broad statutory dele-\\n gations of power to agencies allow \"politically unresponsive administra-\\n tors\" to make \"fundamental policy decisions\" that should be made only by\\n elected officials.150 Many people have characterized this phenomenon as a\\n major flaw in our system of constitutional democracy.\\'5\\' For reasons that I\\n will explain in part VI, I do not share that concern.\\n I do see, however, two major flaws in our system of constitutional de-\\n mocracy that would be created by the ATA majority\\'s attempt to correct\\n what it perceives to be a fatal flaw. The first flaw is obvious and immedi-\\n ate. Two unelected, life-tenured judges have decided that the United States\\n should forego the opportunity to save about 10,000 lives per year in order\\n to save about fifty billion dollars per year. Judges are the least politically\\n accountable officials. They are the worst possible choice of officials to\\n make such fundamental policy decisions in our system of constitutional\\n democracy.52\\n The second unconstitutional and anti-democratic effect of the decision of\\n the ATA majority is less direct and more subtle, but it is equally disturbing.\\n As I understand the D.C. Circuit\\'s 1991, 1994, and 1999 opinions, an\\n agency can save its statute from a holding of unconstitutionality only by\\n 149. See supra text accompanying notes 95-131.\\n 150.

If my\\n interpretation is incorrect, the opinions are incoherent and meaningless. If\\n an agency remains free to change its construction of the statute in the fu-\\n ture, the court has had no effect whatsoever on the agency\\'s degree of dis-\\n cretion or on the ability of reviewing courts to limit agency exercises of\\n discretion. Under that interpretation, the D.C. Circuit has simply used the\\n nondelegation doctrine as a bizarre vehicle to restate the pre-existing legal\\n regime announced in cases such as Chevron US.A. Inc. v. Natural Re-\\n sources Defense Council, Inc.\\'53\\n If my interpretation is correct, the court is ordering President Clinton to\\n make a fundamental policy decision that will bind all of his successors.\\n Such a legal regime would create a real problem for our system of consti-\\n tutional democracy. Its effects would include reducing significantly the in-\\n centive to vote in presidential elections. In the year 2000 election, it is a\\n safe bet that we will have a choice between a Democrat candidate who\\n promises to increase the degree of protection provided by environmental\\n rules and a Republican candidate who promises to reduce the costs of gov-\\n ernment regulation. Millions of people will have the opportunity to vote\\n their preferences with respect to the critical issue that the ATA majority\\n characterizes as \"how much is too much.\"\\n Yet, if the legal regime created by the ATA majority is accepted as a\\n permanent feature of our legal system, the voters who comprise a majority\\n in that election will be frustrated to discover that their vote had no effect on\\n any \"fundamental policy decision.\" If hypothetical future President Gore is\\n elected, he will be powerless to increase the degree of environmental pro-\\n tection provided by EPA rules. If hypothetical future President Bush is\\n elected, he will be powerless to decrease the costs of environmental regu-\\n lation. I would have to reconsider my decision whether to vote in presi-\\n dential elections in such a dramatically transformed political system. Why\\n bother to vote for a new President if the courts will require him to adhere to\\n all of the major policy decisions of one of his predecessors? I would also\\n be much less comfortable living in such a political system. Our system of\\n government would be much less accountable to the people if all funda-\\n 153. 467 U.S. 837; see also I DAVIS & PIERCE, supra note 20, § 3.5 (discussing scope of\\n Chevron). Some commentors on a draft of this paper suggested a third plausible interpreta-\\n tion of the ATA opinion. They suggested that a newly-elected President could use a two-\\n step decisionmaking process. Under this approach, the EPA would first conduct a rule-\\n making in which it announces its construction of section 109(b). For example, section\\n 109(b) requires maximization of public health benefits short of ending industrialization. If a\\n court upholds that construction, the EPA would then conduct rulemakings to set new section\\n 109(b) standards through application of that construction of the statute. That interpretation\\n of the opinion raises a host of problems, however. For starters, no President would have any\\n hope of completing the process during his term of office.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n mental policy decisions had to be made either by unelected, life-tenured\\n judges or by Presidents who can bind their predecessors for decades.\\n VI. BROAD DELEGATIONS OF POWER ARE NOT A THREAT TO\\n CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY\\n In this section, I explain why I do not share the belief of the ATA major-\\n ity that broad delegations of policy making discretion to agencies violate\\n the Constitution and represent a serious flaw in our system of democracy.\\n The answer is simple. \"Fundamental policy decisions,\" like the EPA\\'s\\n ozone and particulate decisions, are not made by \"politically unresponsive\\n administrators,\" except in the most narrow, naive, and formalistic sense.\\n The EPA Administrator is chosen by the President and serves at the pleas-\\n ure of the President. A President cannot \"overrule\" or \"displace\" a deci-\\n sion of the Administrator, but a President can engage in what the D.C. Cir-\\n cuit has characterized as \"jawboning\" or \"arm twisting\" in an attempt to\\n persuade the Administrator to act in a manner consistent with the Presi-\\n dent\\'s preferences.54 There is ample reason to believe that Presidents rou-\\n tinely engage in that practice when an agency makes a \"fundamental policy\\n decision\" and ample reason to believe that presidential jawboning is in-\\n variably successful in that context.55 Thus, it is far more accurate to at-\\n tribute these decisions to the President, as the Supreme Court did in Chev-\\n ron.156  Moreover, the judicially-imposed prohibition on the EPA\\'s\\n consideration of costs in setting air quality standards does not apply to the\\n President. He can, and undoubtedly does, consider costs and benefits in\\n determining his preferences and, hence, the action he urges the Adminis-\\n trator to take.\\n The standard Congress included in section 109(b) is far more determi-\\n nate than the standards it often employs in statutes that\\' delegate power to\\n agencies.157 I have attempted to demonstrate both in this article and else-\\n where that it is absurd to expect Congress to make the types of decisions\\n that the EPA made in the ozone and particulate rulemakings, and that it\\n would be destructive in many ways to demand that Congress make all deci-\\n sions of this type.\\'58 In cases where Congress was able to respond to such a\\n 154. See Sierra Club v. Costle, 657 F.2d 298, 400-10 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (defining presi-\\n dent\\'s power over administrator during rulemaking process).\\n 155. See I DAvIs & PIERCE, supra note 20, at 81-83, § 7.9 (explaining presidential in-\\n fluence over agency decisionmaking).\\n 156. 467 U.S. at 865-66 (discussing propriety of Presidential policy choices in the inter-\\n est of his accountability to the people).\\n 157. See supra text accompanying notes 15-22.\\n 158. See, e.g., Pierce, Role of the Judiciary, supra note 92; Richard J.

If I am right, we are left with limited choices. First, we could as-\\n sign the discretion to make fundamental policy decisions to judges. That is\\n one potential result of the decision in ATA. Second, we could force the in-\\n cumbent President to make a fundamental policy decision that binds his\\n predecessors in perpetuity. That is the other potential result of the decision\\n in ATA. Third, we could assign that discretion to each President, as the Su-\\n preme Court held that we must in Chevron. I find that choice incredibly\\n easy. In our system of constitutional democracy, presidential elections\\n matter. If a majority of the electorate disapproves of how the incumbent\\n President decides \"how much is too much,\" they will elect a new President\\n who will draw the line either higher or lower than the incumbent. That is\\n not a threat to democracy. That is democracy. The Supreme Court de-\\n scribed the principles that apply to such policy disputes in its unanimous\\n opinion in Chevron:\\n While agencies are not directly accountable to the people, the Chief Executive is, and\\n it is entirely appropriate for this political branch of the Government to make such\\n policy choices - resolving the competing interests which Congress ... left to be re-\\n solved by the agency charged with the administration of the statute in light of every-\\n day realities.16°\\n 391 (1986).\\n 159.

Reductions in discretionary\\n spending between 1992 and 1996 have reduced the number of federal em-\\n ployees by 250,000, and the rate of staff reductions will increase in the near\\n future.\\' As Professor Pierce has aptly noted, \"the \\'era of big government\\'\\n really is over, at least as measured with reference to the resources available\\n to agencies to perform their missions.\"9\\n The potential for voluntary industry efforts to reduce health and safety\\n risks or protect the environment is of considerable importance in light of\\n these constraints.\\n Such efforts have been variously described as \"private, voluntary self-\\n regulation,\"\\'0 \"private action,\"\" \"industry self-regulation,\"\\'\\'2 \"voluntary\" or\\n \"private\" standard-setting,13 \"voluntary approaches,\"\\'14 \"voluntary over-\\n compliance,\"\\'15 \"self-control,\"\\'16 \"mandated self-regulation\"\\'17 and \"collabo-\\n rative governance.\"\\'8  These terminologies encompass two situations in\\n which companies respond to incentives other than federal regulation.

In the second situation, firms comply with a legally\\n binding rule or standard in circumstances where violations are unlikely to\\n be detected and punished. Although there is a legal obligation to obey in\\n such cases, the lack of meaningful enforcement makes compliance effec-\\n tively voluntary. For purposes of the following analysis, we consider both\\n situations. For ease of reference, we refer to both situations as \"voluntary\\n regulatory compliance.\"\\n Interest in voluntary regulatory compliance extends beyond its potential\\n to plug the regulatory gap created by ossification and budget reductions.\\n Analysts suggest that voluntary regulatory compliance may be more effi-\\n cient than traditional command and control regulatory approaches because\\n it can produce the same (or more) protection at lower cost.\\'9 Moreover,\\n because it is less intrusive than traditional regulation, it may constitute a\\n new regulatory paradigm, a \"third way\" between traditional regulatory ap-\\n proaches and unregulated markets.20 Similarly, Professor Jody Freeman\\n has proposed that public and private cooperation in standard-setting, im-\\n plementation, and enforcement has reached the point where it is necessary\\n to rethink the normative conceptions legitimizing regulatory government.21\\n This Article evaluates the theory and practice of voluntary regulatory\\n compliance. It constructs an economic model to analyze incentives that\\n may induce an economic actor to engage in voluntary regulatory compli-\\n ance. This model, which has not previously been presented in the litera-\\n ture, integrates the various incentives facing an economic actor, positive\\n and negative, to engage in voluntary regulatory compliance. The Article\\n then evaluates empirical evidence to see whether such incentives have in-\\n duced voluntary action. Although this inquiry focuses on voluntary regu-\\n latory compliance in the OSHA context, it also considers evidence of vol-\\n untary compliance in other contexts, particularly environmental protection.\\n This analysis reveals in what situations voluntary regulatory compliance\\n is more or less likely to occur in general and in the OSHA context. Spe-\\n cifically, it leads to three conclusions. First, while productive in some\\n contexts, voluntary regulatory compliance cannot effectively replace tradi-\\n tional methods of regulation in other contexts. Moreover, as compared to\\n 19. See, e.g., Elliot, supra note 11, at 1852 (noting \"growing consensus\" that non-\\n regulatory incentives offer \"distinct\" advantages over traditional command and control\\n regulation).\\n 20. See Cass R. Sunstein, Private Broadcasters and the Public Interest: Notes Toward a\\n \"Third Way\" (unpublished manuscript, on file with author).\\n 21. Private Parties, Public Functions, supra note 17, at 31-32.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n VOLUNTARY REGULA TORY COMPLIANCE\\n \\n the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA should expect less\\n voluntary compliance because the forces that promote voluntary compli-\\n ance work less effectively concerning occupational safety and health. Sec-\\n ond, armed with the knowledge about when voluntary compliance is likely\\n to occur, agencies should allocate their rulemaking and enforcement re-\\n sources to areas where such compliance is unlikely to protect the environ-\\n ment, consumers, and workers. Third, agencies have a number of ways\\n that they might strengthen the incentives to engage in voluntary regulatory\\n compliance. They should experiment with which options are most likely to\\n have this impact.\\n Our analysis proceeds in three steps. First, Section I develops a cost-\\n based model incorporating existing economic incentives for firms volun-\\n tarily to protect the environment, workers, or consumers. This model in-\\n cludes positive and negative economic incentives for compliance, including\\n abatement, market, regulatory and other costs of compliance. This model\\n also suggests that incentives to protect workers are weaker than incentives\\n to protect the environment. Second, Section II deduces from the model\\n several principles agencies can use to predict when voluntary compliance is\\n most likely to succeed. These principles can guide agencies, particularly\\n OSHA, in deciding when regulations are necessary to induce compliance.\\n Finally, in light of these principles, Section III critiques some strategies\\n OSHA and other agencies have used to induce voluntary compliance and\\n suggests other strategies agencies might try.\\n I. INCENTIVES FOR VOLUNTARY REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\\n A firm\\'s incentives for reducing health and safety risks can be analyzed\\n as a function of four types of costs. Abatement costs (A) are a firm\\'s ex-\\n penses of improving health and safety protection. Regulatory costs (R) are\\n damages a firm pays to those injured by its actions and penalties it pays for\\n failure to obey health and safety regulations. Market costs (M) are the\\n higher costs and lost business opportunities (i.e., opportunity costs) caused\\n by a firm\\'s failure to protect health and safety. According to economic\\n theory, a firm should seek to minimize total costs (TC) or the sum of\\n abatement, regulatory and market costs:\\n minimize TC = A + R + M\\n Economic theory predicts a firm reaches this goal by increasing its\\n abatement costs until they exceed cost reductions the firm achieves from\\n increased abatement spending regarding the three other costs.22\\n 22. Our model assumes that economic actors behave perfectly rational when in fact\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n .  A. Abatement Costs\\n A firm has two types of abatement costs. It has \"information costs,\" or\\n the expense of acquiring knowledge about potential health and safety risks\\n and effective controls for them.21 It also has \"equipment and labor\" ex-\\n penses for the acquisition, installation, maintenance, and monitoring of\\n abatement technologies, or the implementation of work practice or produc-\\n tion rules. The amount of these costs is affected by four circumstances.\\n First, abatement costs are a function of the type of regulation an agency\\n utilizes. Agency use of a specification standard may reduce a firm\\'s infor-\\n mation costs because the standard specifies a method of compliance. At\\n the same time, a specification standard may increase a firm\\'s equipment\\n costs because it limits a firm\\'s ability to rely upon less expensive compli-\\n ance methods.24    Agency use of a performance standard frees firms to\\n choose any compliance method that meets the regulatory goal established\\n by the standard. Although a firm\\'s labor and equipment costs might be\\n lower under a performance standard, information costs may be higher, be-\\n cause the firm must independently determine how to reach the regulatory\\n goal.25\\n Second, the cost of information about health and safety risks or effective\\n controls depends on whether the information is available from public and\\n private sources. Trade associations and professional groups may provide\\n such information.26 Professional standard-setting organizations, such as the\\n they are likely to be subject to bounded rationality. This latter perspective acknowledges\\n that organizations have limited capacities to search for information and solutions to prob-\\n lems and that individuals are subject to cognitive limitations in processing the information\\n that is available. See Dianne Vaughan, Rational Choice, Situated Action, and the Social\\n Control of Organizations, 32 L. & Soc\\'Y REv. 23, 30 (1998) (noting regulators should take\\n account of the fact that rational actor models do not accurately describe how decisions are\\n made). We recognize this limitation of the model, but we believe the model is useful to or-\\n ganize our analysis of incentives to engage in voluntary compliance.\\n 23. See Raymond J. Burby & Robert G. Paterson, Improving Compliance with State\\n Environmental Regulations, 12 J.

In a competitive market, a protective firm will lose business to an\\n unprotective firm unless it can distinguish its product or service to justify\\n its higher price. For example, if enough customers are willing to pay\\n higher prices for organic foods or recycled products, a firm can recover its\\n higher abatement costs.36\\n B.

Personal and Property Injuries\\n A firm will prevent health and safety risks to the point where the cost of\\n further risk reductions exceeds the expected compensation that the firm\\n will pay for injuries or illnesses.37 The expected value of compensation\\n varies by the probability that a firm will pay compensation and the amount\\n of that compensation. Compensation is often less than the actual damages\\n caused by the firm because some injured victims do not seek compensation,\\n some who should receive compensation fail to prove their entitlement, oth-\\n ers will lose despite having legitimate claims, and others recover less than\\n the value of their injuries. Moreover, undercapitalized firms may simply\\n ignore the possibility of paying significant compensation costs because\\n their businesses would be bankrupted if damages were awarded.38\\n When a firm insures against risks for which it might otherwise pay com-\\n pensation, its incentive to abate the risk is further attenuated. A firm will\\n insure only if its insurance costs are less than the expected compensation\\n that the firm otherwise would owe; otherwise, the firm will self-insure.\\n Because insurance is less expensive than paying compensation, it dimin-\\n ishes the incentive to take preventive actions.39  Since an insured firm\\n likely will prevent harms only to the degree its premiums will rise if it does\\n not do so, it may not seek to minimize the full impact of potential damage\\n awards.\\n Firms have fewer incentives to prevent work-related injuries and ill-\\n nesses than other harms. First, workers\\' compensation laws cap the\\n amount of money that employers pay workers for occupational harms at\\n levels less (and often far less) than the victims\\' damages.40 Second, work-\\n ers\\' compensation insurance provides less incentive to engage in preventa-\\n tive actions than other types of insurance liability. The reason is that work-\\n 37. Judgments about expected compensation costs must be made on the basis of per-\\n ception, not reality, because compensation costs are not known until after decisions about\\n incurring abatement costs are made.\\n 38. See CHRISTOPHER D. STONE, WHERE THE LAW ENDS: THE SOCIAL CONTROL OF\\n CORPORATE BEHAVIOR 16 (1975).\\n 39. This analysis assumes that insurance companies base their rates on a firm\\'s health\\n and safety record. When this is not true, insurance further weakens the firm\\'s incentive to\\n engage in the abatement of safety and health risks. See infra notes 41-42 and accompanying\\n text.\\n 40. See Martha T. McCluskey, The Illusion of Efficiency in Workers\\' Compensation\\n \"Reform,\" 50 RUTGERS L. REV. 657, 809-16 (1998) (discussing limits on disability pay-\\n ments); Thomas 0. McGarity & Sidney A.

Insurance companies do not charge small\\n employers based on claims experience; insurance rates only for the largest\\n employers are tied to experience.4\\' As a result of these practices, empirical\\n studies confirm that the incentive effects of workers\\' compensation are\\n \"undetectable\" for many firms.42\\n This analysis suggests that laws would provide increased incentives to\\n protect workers if injured workers received greater compensation, or if an\\n increased use of experience rating in setting insurance rates was required.43\\n States, however, are generally moving in the opposite direction. Competi-\\n tion to attract new industry has created a political environment in which\\n states have modified coverage in the last decade to reduce benefits and\\n limit coverage.4\\n The limited impact of compensation systems in reducing safety and\\n health risks led Congress to conclude that the systems failed to provide\\n adequate protection against such risks. Since the 1970s, Congress has en-\\n acted numerous statutes to protect individuals from many health and safety\\n risks,45 including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act).46\\n 2. Regulatory Enforcement\\n Regulators can require firms to meet specified levels of protection that\\n provide consistent levels of safety and health protection to workers,\\n whereas duties imposed in tort vary widely. Obedience to these rules de-\\n pends on the likelihood that regulatory costs will be imposed and the mag-\\n nitude of those costs. Regulatory costs consist of fines, or the costs to a\\n firm that are related to criminal prosecution or any jail sentence imposed on\\n a manager.\\n 41. Insurance rates for small firms are based on claims experience of all similarly sized\\n businesses (pure community rating) or all similar kinds of business (manual rating). In ei-\\n ther case, a small firm lacks the same insurance pricing incentive as a firm whose insurance\\n rates are based on its actual accident experience (experience rating).

Fines\\n Regulatory agencies normally assess civil fines to punish a failure to\\n comply with regulations.47 The expected fine is the product of the prob-\\n ability (p) the government will detect violations times the amount of the\\n fine (f) it will assess.48 A firm will comply with regulations when the gain\\n (g) it expects from noncompliance exceeds the expected fine for a viola-\\n tion:\\n g >P(f)\\n Thus, if a firm will gain a substantial sum of money (or avoid substantial\\n costs) from noncompliance, it will not comply with rules if the risk of be-\\n ing caught is minimal or the potential fine is small.49 In cases where there\\n is a small probability of detection and a great reward for law breaking, the\\n government may not be able to assess a fine large enough to deter the con-\\n duct.50\\n Budget limitations circumscribe an agency\\'s ability to detect violations,\\n and if violations are detected, budget constraints may encourage case set-\\n tlements for less than the fines originally assessed.5\\' In many instances,\\n 47. In addition, Congress has authorized criminal sanctions of corporations, usually\\n payment of a fine in some circumstances. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 6903(15) (1994) (noting\\n definition of \"person\" under RCRA includes corporations); see also 42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)\\n (1994) (authorizing criminal indictment of \"persons\" under RCRA). Criminal sanctions dif-\\n fer from civil sanctions in two ways: the fines are usually higher, and criminal sanctions are\\n more likely to increase a firm\\'s market and labor costs, as we discuss in later sections. See\\n infra notes 74-78 and accompanying text (discussing relationship of corporate criminal fines\\n and market costs); infra notes 141-43 and accompanying text (discussing relationship of\\n corporate criminal fines and labor costs).\\n 48. See W. Kip Viscusi, Reforming OSHA Regulation of Workplace Risks, in\\n REGULATORY REFORM: WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED 234, 259 (Leonard W. Weiss & Mi-\\n chael W. Klass eds., 1986) (employer\\'s incentive to obey regulations is a function of the\\n likelihood that OSHA will detect violations and the amount of the fines it will assess).\\n 49. For example, if it would cost a firm $100,000 to obey a regulation, it should com-\\n ply only if the expected fine is more than $100,000. If the firm has only one chance in ten\\n of being caught, the firm will initiate abatement only if the fine exceeds $1 million.\\n 50. Moreover, in assessing fines, the government is subject to a \"deterrence trap.\" If\\n the rewards of wrongdoing yield millions of dollars, but the probability of detection is small,\\n the government will have to impose a fine that totals billions of dollars to deter the behavior.\\n If the government has good economic and political reasons to hold back from punishments\\n that harm innocent workers, communities, and credits in this manner, its efforts to obtain\\n compliance are weakened.\\n 51. An agency, however, may gain additional compliance to the extent regulated enti-\\n ties do not realize how low the expected penalty is for noncompliance. See JAMES K.\\n HAMMIT & PETER REUTER, MEASURING AND DETERRING ILLEGAL DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS\\n WASTE: A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT 18-19 (1988) (citing survey evidence that small\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W-REVIEW\\n \\n agency regulations are under-enforced in the following sense: agencies\\n could induce additional compliance if they detected more violations (or as-\\n sessed higher penalties) because the cost of abatement would be less than\\n the expected value of the fines.\\n OSHA faces this problem. OSHA has about 1,000 inspectors to cover\\n more than 6.5 million employers.52 Although it concentrates its inspections\\n on the most dangerous industries,53 this strategy still leaves significant en-\\n forcement gaps. OSHA has resources to visit high-hazard workplaces only\\n once every thirteen years and every workplace once every eighty-seven\\n years.54 As a result, \"seventy-five percent of the sites where workers suf-\\n fered serious accidents in 1994 and early 1995 had not had a federal safety\\n inspection since 1990.\"\" When OSHA does find a violation, it often set-\\n tles it for one-half or less of the assessed amount.56 Research indicates that\\n when OSH1A concentrates its enforcement efforts on certain hazards, e.g.,\\n protection against falls, and the chance of detecting violations therefore in-\\n creases, so does compliance.57\\n OSHA enforcement creates fewer incentives for compliance than en-\\n forcement by other agencies for two reasons. First, OSHA is less likely\\n than other agencies to detect rule violations because other agencies have\\n more inspectors. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), for\\n example, has jurisdiction over far fewer employers, but it has about two\\n hundred more inspectors than OSHA. One study suggests these increased\\n resources improve MSHA\\'s effectiveness.58 In addition, unlike private\\n quantity generators of hazardous waste significantly overestimate the probability they will\\n be subject to govern inspection).\\n 52.

See, e.g., MCGARITY & SHAPIRO, supra note 3, at 217 (stating OSHA collects less\\n than one-half of the fines it assesses). If OSHA fines are contested, employers are not re-\\n quired to abate the violation. See 29 U.S.C. § 666(d) (1994). OSHA settles so many cases\\n to encourage prompt abatement of violations.

Since 1990, the agency has had\\n the authority to impose a maximum fine of $70,000 for a willful or repeat\\n violation and $7,000 for a serious violation.6\\' OSHA has found a way to\\n increase these penalties when an employer has engaged in \"egregious con-\\n duct.\" For such conduct, OSHA assesses separate penalties for each em-\\n ployee exposed to violative conditions. This can result in \"mega-fines\"\\n totaling a million dollars or more. This policy increases the incentive to\\n comply with OSHA regulations, but it does not apply in circumstances\\n where there is only one hazard to be abated, even if the violation causes\\n multiple fatalities.62 By comparison, fines are much higher under the envi-\\n ronmental laws. EPA is authorized, for example, to impose fines of up to\\n $25,000 per day for negligent violations of the Clean Water Act (CWA)\\n and up to $50,000 per day for repeat negligent and knowing violations.63\\n Similarly, fines are higher for the equivalent of egregious conduct under\\n the environmental laws. For example, EPA can impose civil fines of\\n $250,000 per day and a criminal fine of up to $1 million for violations of\\n the CWA that knowingly endanger the public.64\\n Even when detection and punishment of violations seem unlikely, a firm\\n may have an incentive to comply with rules if its failure to do so may have\\n one of four potential consequences. First, regulators may monitor for fu-\\n ture violations more closely or increase subsequent penalties after viola-\\n INSPECTION TARGETING: CAUSES AND EFFECTS 16, 20 (1988).\\n 59.

Prevention also saves money for a related reason. When a business\\n receives unwanted public attention due to an accident or other incident, it\\n must significantly increase the resources devoted to its public relations and\\n intergovernmental relations functions.69   Third, a firm  may self-report a\\n violation if enforcement officials offer a significant incentive to do so.7°\\n 65.

Moreover, even if they do so, they may discount\\n these future costs, reducing present incentives to respond to them.73\\n b. Jail Sentences\\n Potential jail sentences for corporate officials who violate regulations\\n create an additional incentive for compliance. When punishment consists\\n of a jail sentence, firm managers will consider both the expected value of\\n jail sentences, which equals the probability (p) that a violation will be de-\\n tected, the length of the sentence (t) and the disutility (X) to the employee\\n who will serve that time. According to economic theory, the firm will con-\\n sider potential jail sentences because an employee will demand to be com-\\n pensated for undertaking such a risk. Thus, a firm will commit a violation\\n with potential criminal penalties if and only if the gain (g) exceeds the ex-\\n pected value of the cost of any fines and imprisonment:\\n g > p (f+ X0)\\n As the formula indicates, an agency can increase a company\\'s incentive\\n to comply with its regulations by increasing the potential for prosecutions\\n and by seeking longer jail sentences.\\n At OSHA, however, this formula is unlikely to hold true. Criminal pen-\\n alties seldom come into play. A firm acts criminally only if its \"willful\"\\n violation of an OSHA standard causes an employee\\'s death.74 Only corpo-\\n 71. See infra notes 80-92 and accompanying text (discussing impact of violations in\\n consumer, producer, and capital markets).\\n 72. See infra notes 124-35 and accompanying text (discussing relationship between\\n social norms, violations, and the anxiety and prestige of managers).\\n 73. See Tomer, supra note 23, at 131 (indicating a firm\\'s \"patience\" in sacrificing\\n short-term for long-term gains \"corresponds roughly to the rate of discount ....\\'). For ex-\\n ample, a firm may choose not to comply with health precautions that reduce the number of\\n employees who become ill 20 years from now. The reason is that the present value of future\\n savings in compensation costs is less than the cost of compliance. See Elinor P. Schroeder\\n & Sidney A. Shapiro, Responses to Occupational Disease: The Role of Markets, Regulation,\\n and Information, 72 GEO. L.J. 1231, 1244-56 (1984) (discussing employer incentives to\\n prevent occupational illnesses). Moreover, the analysis assumes that managers accurately\\n calculate future liabilities, but they might employ an abnormally high discount rate that will\\n dilute the present value of future penalties. See STONE, supra note 38, at 16.\\n 74. 29 U.S.C. § 666(e) (1994); Lynn K. Rhinehart, Would Workers Be Better Protected\\n If They Were Declared an Endangered Species? A Comparison of Criminal Enforcement\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n rate officers are subject to a criminal penalty; thus, lower level managers\\n who may have been directly responsible for a workplace fatality are ex-\\n empt.75 Only one employer has served jail time since 1971 .76 By compari-\\n son, the EPA jailed 228 people between 1987 and 1993 for violating fed-\\n eral environmental laws.\"    Moreover, federal law  authorizes longer\\n sentences for environmental violations, while OSHA criminal violations\\n are misdemeanors. For example, a person who violates the Clean Air Act\\n by knowingly endangering others can be jailed for up to fifteen years.78\\n The limited availability of criminal penalties under the OSH Act robs the\\n agency of a potentially powerful enforcement tool. Even when the possi-\\n bility of prosecution is remote, criminal penalties can create a significant\\n incentive to comply with agency rules. If a manager is extremely risk ad-\\n verse (i.e., has a high disutility), the manager will strongly disfavor viola-\\n tion of regulations that could lead to a jail sentence, even if the probability\\n of detection is low. In such cases, managers treat the probability of detec-\\n tion as one hundred percent. Besides the disutility of serving a jail sen-\\n tence, criminal penalties impose large social costs on managers. This loss\\n of prestige occurs regardless of the length of sentence.\\n This analysis suggests that Congress can gain greater compliance by\\n broadly authorizing criminal prosecutions.79 For example, if OSHA oper-\\n ated under the same standard as EPA uses under the CWA - knowing en-\\n dangerment - more managers would be potentially subject to a jail sen-\\n tence. Even if the actual probability of prosecution remained low, the\\n change could still promote additional compliance.\\n C. Market Costs\\n A firm\\'s regulatory cost is a function of the nature and degree of regu-\\n latory enforcement. A firm can decrease its regulatory costs by complying\\n with applicable laws and regulations. Increased prevention can reduce a\\n firm\\'s \"market\" costs. A market cost is a cost that occurs in a firm\\'s prod-\\n uct, supply, capital, and labor markets and is impacted by the firm\\'s level\\n of prevention.\\n Under the Federal Workplace Safety and Environmental Protection Laws, 31 Am.

Product and Service Markets\\n A firm\\'s safety and health compliance may determine whether ordinary\\n and industrial customers purchase its product. A firm with a poor compli-\\n ance record may lose customers or, conversely, may fail to attract consum-\\n ers who prefer to purchase goods and services from businesses with a re-\\n sponsible record for human and environmental protection.\\n Consumers are most likely to stop purchasing an unsafe product or\\n service once they become aware of the defect. Besides engaging in such\\n self-protection, they might decline to purchase a firm\\'s products where its\\n poor safety and health record puts others at risk or where the firm fails in\\n some other manner to act responsibly.80 This \"exit\" from a market allows a\\n consumer to indirectly \"bargain\" over a firm\\'s commitment to prevention\\n without incurring high transaction costs.8s Activists may seek to prompt\\n this response by announcing a consumer boycott in the media.82 Examples\\n include the widespread protests against companies doing business in South\\n Africa, and against Nestle Corporation for its practices of marketing un-\\n healthful products in the Third World.83 A firm may also lose industrial or\\n business customers if they view a poor safety or environmental record as\\n evidence the firm is poorly managed and unreliable.84 A firm can reduce\\n the (direct and indirect) loss of business by improving its performance.85\\n 80.

In addition, a poor safety and health record may cause a loss of supplier confi-\\n dence, which could result in an increase in the price of raw materials and other supplies.\\n The purchasing firm can obtain lower prices by taking precautions that reduce the likelihood\\n of accidents or environmental injuries. See Warneryd & Lewis, supra note 80, at 6 (sug-\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n A firm\\'s compliance record can have the opposite effect as well: it might\\n encourage consumers to buy the firm\\'s products or services. As noted ear-\\n lier, some consumers are willing to pay higher prices for products that are\\n less likely to injure the environment.86 For example, Star Kist\\'s sales and\\n profits went up after the company raised its prices to cover the added cost\\n of purchasing tuna only from suppliers who used dolphin-safe nets.7 More\\n generally, consumers may favor firms with a good reputation for environ-\\n mental protection or social responsibility.\"8 There is evidence, for exam-\\n ple, that Ben and Jerry\\'s sells more ice cream because of its Amazon rain\\n forest preservation efforts, and that McDonalds sells more hamburgers be-\\n cause it supports parents of seriously ill children.89 If consumers react in\\n this manner, the failure to engage in protection is a cost to the firm (i.e.,\\n opportunity cost) because it results in lost sales.\\n The general significance of these market forces in the areas of environ-\\n mental and social responsibility is unknown. Besides the type of anecdotal\\n evidence described above, there is only \"sparse\" empirical evidence of the\\n impact of product markets on prevention levels. After a literature review,\\n Lyon and Maxwell conclude, for example, that there is no empirical basis\\n for predicting when such market forces are likely to prompt voluntary re-\\n ductions in pollution.90 Some studies show that firms dealing directly with\\n gesting that suppliers might decline to deal with unethical firms).\\n 85.

The public normally has little or no\\n information about a firm\\'s workplace safety and health record, and most\\n workplace accidents go unreported in the media.93 Moreover, because oc-\\n cupational risks pose no direct threat to consumers, they notice them less\\n often, except when a catastrophic incident occurs. In addition, consumers\\n may not be able to reduce purchases from unsafe employers because the\\n goods and services they produce often are not sold directly to the public.\\n Finally, although there are readily identifiable examples of \"green market-\\n ing\" (i.e., firms advertising their environmental achievements), it is more\\n difficult to find efforts by firms to advertise workplace safety and health\\n records. This fact suggests that businesses believe workplace safety and\\n health are not factors considered in consumer purchasing decisions.\\n It is more likely that a firm\\'s safety and health record will impact its\\n costs in situations where its actions adversely affect third parties other than\\n consumers. For example, the suppliers of equipment or raw materials may\\n be liable to employees of their customers if a workplace injury or illness is\\n related to defects in such equipment or raw materials. These suppliers will\\n establish the price for their products based in part on the likelihood of such\\n liability. Firms that protect employees from injuries from such equipment\\n and materials can charge suppliers lower prices. Similarly, a contractor (or\\n the general contractor) may be liable for a construction accident that injures\\n 91. See, e.g, Seema Arora & Timothy N.

Capital Markets\\n A firm that improves its safety and environmental record may retain ex-\\n isting customers and attract new ones. A firm\\'s safety and health record\\n can also impact the price of a firm\\'s stock. Economic theory predicts that\\n security prices in an efficient capital market provide the best, unbiased es-\\n timate of a company\\'s assets.94 Under this efficient market hypothesis, a\\n firm\\'s stock price will decrease when investors obtain information that in-\\n dicates its future earnings are likely to decline.95 If investors regard new\\n information about a firm\\'s environmental or safety and health record as in-\\n dicative of lower future earnings, the announcement of such information\\n should be associated with a decline in the firm\\'s stock price. Conversely, a\\n firm can avoid a loss in value of its stock by taking preventative actions\\n that reduce the likelihood of safety or environmental problems.\\n Investors might regard negative news about a firm\\'s safety or environ-\\n mental record as indicating lower future earnings for several reasons. If a\\n firm is likely to be (or has been) fined by regulators or has to pay (or has\\n paid) tort damages, investors may anticipate a decline in future earnings,\\n particularly if these payments are likely to cost millions of dollars. Simi-\\n larly, if the news is likely to lead to a decline in sales, investors can expect\\n a decline in earnings. When a firm is accused (or convicted) of consumer\\n fraud, for example, investors may predict there will be a decline in con-\\n sumer demand for its products or services. Investors may also anticipate a\\n loss of earnings for more indirect and general reasons. For example, they\\n might decide that a firm with a poor reputation for environmental protec-\\n tion is generally poorly managed, which means that it is likely to earn less\\n in the future. Or, investors may decide that such a firm is likely to have\\n 94. See Eugene F. Fama, Efficient Capital Markets: 1, 46 J. FiN. 1575 (1991); Eugene\\n F. Fama, Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work, 25 J. FIN. 383\\n (1970). When investors obtain new information about a firm\\'s performance, they will re-\\n evaluate the firm\\'s expected cash flows and buy or sell the firm\\'s securities in the stock\\n market as appropriate. Such trades affect both the firm\\'s stock prices and investors\\' market\\n returns. See Shameek Konar & Mark A. Cohen, Information as Regulation: The Effect of\\n Community Right to Know Laws on Toxic Emissions, 32 J. ENvTL. EcoN. & MGMT. 109,\\n 111 (1997).\\n 95. New information is incorporated into the price of a firm\\'s stock because it creates\\n arbitrage opportunities. If the new information indicates that the cash flow is likely to de-\\n crease, the firm\\'s stock is over valued. Investors aware of this opportunity will sell the\\n firm\\'s stock, which will change its price and the return that investors can expect from their\\n ownership.\\n 96.

This method compares the actual price of the firm\\'s stock on the day of or after the\\n announcement with a prediction of the price based on prior movements in the price of the\\n stock.

It is un-\\n clear how long this effect lasts. It is less clear whether the decline in the\\n price of a firm\\'s stock constitutes a \"reputational\" penalty. Such a penalty\\n would exist if the firm\\'s loss in stock market value exceeds its expected (or\\n actual) liability for fines or tort liability.  In other words, it is not clear\\n whether investors anticipate that a firm\\'s environmental or safety record\\n will cause a loss of earnings attributable to consumer reaction or poor man-\\n agement.

Labor Markets\\n A firm with a poor safety or environmental record may lose customers,\\n pay higher prices for machinery, and suffer a decline in the value of the\\n price of its stock. Economic theory predicts that a firm may also have\\n higher labor costs of two types. Employees exposed to workplace risks\\n may demand compensation (i.e., a risk premium) for being exposed to the\\n risk of injury or disease. Executives who are subject to social sanctions or\\n personal discomfort because of a firm\\'s poor safety or environmental rec-\\n ord may demand compensation (i.e., a reservation pay premium) for en-\\n during this discomfort. Although these are hardly equivalent situations -\\n the worker may be exposed to the risk of serious bodily injury or death and\\n the executive may be subject to psychological discomfort - in theory both\\n present an incentive to the firm to engage in preventative efforts. In reality,\\n these costs appear to create only weak incentives in many situations.\\n a. Risk Premiums\\n Economic theory predicts that workers will seek safer jobs unless em-\\n ployers compensate them for workplace risks.109 If so, an employer will\\n calculate whether it is less expensive to reduce a workplace hazard or pay\\n workers a risk premium. Firms should reduce occupational risks until the\\n marginal cost of making the next risk reduction is more than the extra com-\\n pensation workers demand.\"0 Consistent with this theory, some studies\\n have found that workers in dangerous jobs receive higher wages after ad-\\n justing for education, experience, and other market characteristics of safety\\n hazards. \"\\'\\n Reputations of Finns (unpublished paper, on file with author) (finding insignificant stock\\n market response to a sample of all negative environmental incidents - regulatory and non-\\n regulatory - over a 22 year period involving oil firms and electrical power companies);\\n Jonathan M.

Viscusi, for\\n example, has found that annual compensation for all job risks totals about $400. Id. at 40.\\n Although compensation is only $400, Viscusi estimates that workers receive a premium of\\n $1 to $1.5 million per fatality and $10,000 per injury in 1969 dollars. Id. The actual\\n amount that workers receive is only $400 because, according to Viscusi\\'s statistics, they\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n Despite such empirical data, it is unlikely that workers receive wage\\n premiums that fully compensate them for work-related risks. For wage\\n premiums to be fully compensating, workers (or at least some workers)\\n must be fully informed about work-related risks. The existence of wage\\n premiums indicates that workers have some knowledge of workplace risks,\\n but survey research by James Robinson indicates that the extent of that\\n knowledge is limited.\"12\\n Even workers with some knowledge of workplace risks must be able to discern mar-\\n ginal differences in risks to bargain effectively for appropriate hazard pay. Such dis-\\n tinctions are especially difficult to make in the context of occupational illness, where\\n huge uncertainties befuddle attempts to predict the precise effects of health risks on\\n longevity and the quality of life once a disease has manifested itself.\"3\\n Workers must also be free of psychological defects that distort the way\\n in which individuals process risk information, but individuals commonly\\n misperceive the degree of risk that they face.\"14   Finally, the additional\\n compensation that a worker can obtain for hazardous work is a function of\\n the worker\\'s bargaining power. In those situations in which employees can\\n be easily replaced and for whom alternative jobs are not readily available,\\n an employee cannot be very demanding in seeking hazard pay.\"15\\n There are also reasons to distrust the empirical data establishing that\\n wage premiums exist. Existing studies of wage premiums likely overstate\\n the amount of hazard pay because such studies rely on accident data that\\n understates the extent of workplace fatalities and injuries. If the accident\\n rate is higher than existing data indicate, then wage premiums compensate\\n less than studies indicate.16 In addition, studies of wage premiums are\\n have only a small chance of being killed or injured.\\n 112. Using national survey data, Robinson found that 33% to 50% of workers in occu-\\n pations with high rates of disabling injuries and illnesses reported that they faced no signifi-\\n cant safety or health hazards.

Al-\\n though workers were more likely to recognize cancer risks in industries where such risks\\n were high, only 13% to 33% recognized that they were exposed to a significant risk. Id at\\n 24.

See McGarity & Shapiro, supra note 40, at 591-92 (citing studies finding that ex-\\n isting statistics underestimate workplace risks).

There is little empirical\\n evidence that workers receive wage premiums for occupational health\\n risks.\\' \\'\\n Further, the evidence of wage premiums found by analysts may be at-\\n tributable to labor market conditions other than accident risks. Many fac-\\n tors affect wage levels, including the risk of injury or death, and higher\\n wages in dangerous industries may be attributable to these other factors.\\n Although risk studies have taken into account some of these characteristics,\\n they have not tested for other factors that might explain higher wages.\\n Studies that test for such factors have found that higher risk levels do not\\n necessarily explain the higher wages paid to employees.\"l8 For example,\\n Dorman and Hagstrom, after accounting for multiple factors that might ex-\\n plain higher wages, found no evidence that workers receive compensation\\n for the risk of fatal and nonfatal injuries except for one measure of fatality\\n risk.\"9 As a result, they conclude, \"[t]hese results cast doubt on the very\\n existence of compensating differentials for all workers, union and nonunion\\n alike.,\\'2°\\n Finally, there is evidence that wages are lower, not higher, in some dan-\\n gerous occupations. Dorman and Hagstrom found evidence of a negative\\n correlation (i.e., relatively high risk and low wages) for nonunion workers\\n in risky occupations.12\\' James Robinson likewise has found that because\\n hazardous jobs paid twenty to thirty percent less than safe employment,\\n persons with education and training will avoid such jobs.122 This evidence\\n based on existing statistics about the extent of workplace risks, which he finds to be \"im-\\n pressive\" compensation. Viscusi, supra note I 11, at 40. If, as appears to be true, injury\\n risks are greater than indicated by the data used by Viscusi, workers receive a lower pre-\\n mium for dangerous work than he estimates.\\n 117. The data are so poor regarding the risks of occupational disease that economists\\n have been unable to test whether employees receive compensation for such risks.

Reservation Pay Premiums\\n Economic theory predicts that a firm will have to compensate its manag-\\n ers for any loss of prestige or anxiety they suffer from the firm\\'s failure to\\n protect safety and health. A manager may be subject to these reactions\\n when a safety and health standard becomes a behavioral norm.\\n Norms \"specify what actions are regarded by a set of persons as proper\\n or correct, or improper or incorrect.\\'24 They are \"ordinarily enforced by\\n sanctions,\" which are either rewards for proper behavior or punishments for\\n improper behavior, imposed by other persons.\\'2    Thus, managers who fail\\n to conform to a safety norm may experience \"discomfort or harassment, as\\n well as reduced prestige and prominence .... as a result of pressure from\\n activist community groups or others external to the firm.\\'26 A norm may\\n also be \"internal to the individual carrying out the action, with sanctions\\n applied by that individual to his own actions.\\'27 Internalization occurs\\n through socialization,\\'28 including professional training.29 When a norm is\\n illnesses than others.

When workplace injuries or illnesses cause employees to miss work, a firm\\'s produc-\\n tivity will decline if their replacements are less experienced or skilled. Conversely, atten-\\n tion to safety can increase the loyalty of employees, which has a positive impact on\\n productivity. See, e.g., A Gift From the Heart, WHARTON ALUMNI MAG., Fall 1998, at I I\\n (attributing low turnover to employee loyalty generated by, in part, firm dedication to\\n safety).

For example,\\n there is little probability that the police will arrest someone for violating a\\n smoking ban, but social pressure causes almost all smokers to obey such\\n restrictions.136 For norms to function in this manner, most people must\\n comply with a norm. When there is low compliance, there will be less\\n community pressure to obey the norm,137 and individuals are less likely to\\n feel \"guilty\" about not obeying the norm. The latter reaction occurs be-\\n cause most persons \"loathe being taken advantage of.\\'138 For example, a\\n taxpayer\\'s decision to pay taxes is influenced more by the person\\'s percep-\\n tion of whether others in the same situation are paying their taxes than by\\n the tax burden or the person\\'s perception of potential penalties for non-\\n compliance.139\\n In theory, social norms might compel compliance with occupational\\n safety and health regulations in situations where OSHA is unlikely to detect\\n noncompliance. In practice, social norms probably do not have this impact.\\n Unlike the smoking example given above, the public is unlikely to become\\n aware of noncompliance with workplace safety and health rules, thereby\\n inhibiting the imposition of social sanctions.40 Nevertheless, a manager\\n might feel compelled to obey OSHA regulations because the person feels a\\n general duty to obey the law or because the manager has internalized a\\n norm to follow safety and health rules as part of his or her professional\\n training.\\n Second, criminal sanctions can promote greater compliance than civil\\n penalties.

A legal norm can di-\\n lute the impact of social norms (and thereby reduce economic incentives to\\n take preventative actions).144 Workers\\' compensation has this impact be-\\n cause it eliminates the notion that managers are \"at fault\" for workplace\\n injuries. It assumes instead that a substantial number of employment acci-\\n dents are inevitable, rather than the responsibility of the employer to pre-\\n vent.45 The law creates this belief because it does not require employers to\\n reimburse workers for all, or often even most, of the damages arising from\\n occupational accidents and illnesses.46 The fact that workers and employ-\\n ers share the cost of accidents suggests that workers and employers are\\n jointly responsible for these costs. Yet, the idea of joint responsibility is\\n patently inconsistent with the employer\\'s exclusive right to control most\\n decisions affecting workers\\' health and safety.147 Workers compensation\\n 141.

Norms and Corporate Culture\\n The previous analysis assumes that firms compensate managers for their\\n personal costs arising from the firm\\'s failure to abide by safety and health\\n norms. As in the case of wage premiums, actual practices vary from eco-\\n nomic theory predictions. One reason that actual practice varies is because\\n managers may be subject to norms resistant to safety and health protec-\\n tions. There may be a culture of resistance among executives belonging to\\n the same trade association, or the corporate culture inside a firm may resist\\n regulatory efforts to promote safety and health. For example, peers outside\\n or inside the corporation may believe that cooperation with government\\n regulators is undesirable and contrary to the best interests of business and\\n society. In addition, people often resort to psychological defense mecha-\\n nisms, such as rationalization, when their actions are inconsistent with im-\\n portant norms.149 For example, a manager may blame employees for a\\n workplace accident or attribute the accident to forces beyond the person\\'s\\n control.150\\n Once the possibility of other norms and defense mechanisms is taken\\n into account, it is more probable that firms with the worst safety and health\\n records may be able to avoid paying compensation to managers by seeking\\n out executives who tolerate unlawful and antisocial behavior. They would\\n seek to hire such persons because these managers would demand less com-\\n pensation, or even no compensation, for the firm\\'s failure to protect the\\n safety and health of workers. In other words, such firms will hire execu-\\n tives who have low costs for being social pariahs.\\n of accidents and illnesses to workers and to create disincentives for employers to provide\\n safer work places.

See FIONA HAINES, CORPORATE REGULATION: BEYOND \"PUNISH OR PERSUADE\" 83-\\n 84 (1997). Ralph Nader suggests that corporate managers (and others) use \"pitiless abstrac-\\n tion\" as another defense mechanism. In this response, corporate managers stay far removed\\n from the dangerous day-to-day activity of their businesses, which permits them to ignore the\\n risks that workers face.

REv. 1, 4-5 (1994).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n VOLUNTARY REGULA TORY COMPLIANCE\\n \\n The impact of social norms then will depend on the strength of the\\n norms, the extent to which corporate culture reinforces or contradicts such\\n norms, and the psychological defense mechanisms of managers. A recent\\n book by Fiona Haines studies the interplay of these factors in the context of\\n thirty-seven Australian firms and government agencies responsible (at least\\n in part) for a worker\\'s death at a multi-employer work site during 1987.5\\'\\n Seven of the firms undertook a \"virtuous\" response that involved a reex-\\n amination of the organization\\'s safety levels, a reemphasis of current safety\\n policy, and some alteration of their workplaces or practices.152 The other\\n firms engaged in a \"blinkered response\" that was unlikely to prevent future\\n accidents.\\'53  After extensive interviews with the participants, Haines\\n reached three conclusions.\\n First, Haines concluded that rationalization by firm managers could not\\n satisfactorily explain the differing responses. She found that executives\\n who undertook a \"virtuous\" response, as well as those that did not, tried to\\n distance themselves psychologically from the deaths of workers.154 This\\n suggested to her that such techniques are a method of \"coping\" with tragic\\n events.155\\n Second, Haines concluded firms that undertook a virtuous response had\\n a corporate culture that averted the \"organizational distancing process\" that\\n led to a \"blinkered\" response in the other firms.\\'56 She explains, \"[t]he key\\n element differentiating the two cultures was that the virtuous culture would\\n 151.

Employees here know that for me to lose one of them\\n would be like losing one of my children. I think the fact that we can focus on safety\\n issues no matter what the cost, and not have to worry about quarterly earnings and\\n dividends, gives us a very different sense of direction. The employee is the object of\\n our attention, and not earnings per share.\\n A Gift From the Heart, supra note 123, at II.\\n 153.

As a result,\\n [c]oping with tragedy in the context of health and safety involving ongoing threats to\\n human life is a two-edged sword, with the possibility of distancing oneself and the\\n company from the death so completely that individual managers are persuaded that\\n either the incident was inevitable and therefore nothing could have prevented it, or\\n the culpability of another organization exonerates them from any need to act.\\n Id. at 91-92.\\n 156.

Smaller firms were more likely to respond in a blinkered\\n manner than large firms,58 leading to the conclusion that \"the weak posi-\\n tion of small business in the market-place as a whole constrains\\n virtue...,,1   However, some large firms, which had the size and power to\\n respond in a virtuous manner, failed to do so.160 In these cases, top man-\\n agement failed to establish a safety culture within the organization.\\'61\\n II. THE PROBABILITY OF VOLUNTARY REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\\n A firm voluntarily complies with regulations when it engages in pre-\\n ventative efforts not required by government regulation or when it com-\\n plies with regulatory requirements whose violation is unlikely to be de-\\n tected.62 If agencies could predict when voluntary compliance is likely,\\n they could concentrate resources on regulating non-complying businesses.\\n This section builds on the prior analysis to identify what factors make it\\n more likely that a firm will voluntarily comply with rules. We then con-\\n sider two additional factors that impact the likelihood of voluntary compli-\\n 157. Id. at 95. In the \"blinkered\" culture, workers were seen as \"the major cause of in-\\n jury and death, with carelessness and forgetfulness seen as the predominant reason for inci-\\n dents occurring.\" Id. at 96. Further, there would be an \"\\'us and them\\' attitude which would\\n breed suspicion of those outside the workplace; unions would be seen as interfering and\\n self-interested, and regulators would be kept at bay.\" Id. Other studies have found that an\\n important determinant of a company\\'s response to new safety regulations is its existing\\n safety culture. See, e.g., Alfred Marcus, Implementing Externally Induced Innovations: A\\n Comparison of the Rule-bound and Autonomous Approaches, 31 AcAD. MGMT.

A firm might obey a regulation despite a low probability of being apprehended for\\n a violation if the fine to which it would be subject is large enough. As discussed, however,\\n agencies, including OSHA, are often unable to assess fines of a sufficient magnitude to cre-\\n ate an incentive to obey a regulation. See supra notes 61-64 and accompanying text.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n VOLUNTARY REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\\n \\n ance: the size of a firm and the existence of private safety and environ-\\n mental standards.\\n A. General Predictive Factors\\n According to the cost minimization model, a firm will spend money on\\n reducing health, safety, or environmental risks when such expenditures re-\\n duce its regulatory costs and market costs by more than the amount spent\\n on abatement. In the absence of regulatory enforcement, the following\\n factors appear to predict when voluntary compliance will occur.\\n (i) Voluntary compliance is more likely when prevention costs are low.\\n A firm\\'s incentive to reduce health, safety or environmental risks depends\\n on the amount of its prevention costs as compared to potential savings in\\n other costs. All other things being equal, it is more likely that the potential\\n savings will exceed prevention costs when the latter are low because even\\n small reductions in regulatory and market costs will justify voluntary com-\\n pliance. The prior analysis indicates that prevention costs are related to\\n two factors. One is whether a firm has low-cost access to information\\n about risks and prevention. Such information may be available from trade\\n associations, standard-setting organizations, or the government.163  The\\n other is whether its competitors also engage in voluntary compliance. This\\n circumstance makes it more likely that the firm is able to pass on preven-\\n tion costs to the public.\\'64\\n (ii) Voluntary compliance is more likely when there is a good chance a\\n firm will pay compensation for personal or property damage. In the ab-\\n sence of a credible threat of agency enforcement, a firm\\'s regulatory costs\\n consist of potential personal and property damages that it must pay. All\\n other things being equal, voluntary compliance to avoid liability costs is\\n related to two factors. There should be greater compliance to the extent\\n that damages are not limited. Since workers\\' compensation caps damages,\\n less voluntary compliance with occupational safety and health standards\\n can be expected. Third parties, such as equipment manufacturers and gen-\\n eral contractors, are likely to engage in greater voluntary compliance than\\n employers, whose damages are capped by workers\\' compensation. Greater\\n abatement should occur when insurance rates are based on an employer\\'s\\n actual accident experience. As this is not the case for many small and me-\\n dium-size employers, insurance rating dilutes the already-diluted economic\\n incentives of workers\\' compensation systems. 65\\n 163. See supra notes 26-29 and accompanying text.\\n 164. See supra note 35 and accompanying text.\\n 165. See supra notes 40-42 and accompanying text.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n (iii) Voluntary compliance is more likely when there is a greater likeli-\\n hood that a firm\\'s customers will take into account its compliance record\\n in making purchasing decisions. Anecdotal evidence indicates that some\\n consumers may decline to purchase goods or services from a firm that en-\\n gages in activities objectionable to them, and that they will pay higher\\n prices for goods or services from a firm that adheres to their social (i.e.,\\n policy) goals. There is some empirical evidence that, because investors\\n recognize this phenomenon, a firm suffers a reputational penalty for its\\n failure to protect the environment, although other studies fail to confirm\\n this impact.66 Firms do not appear to suffer a reputational penalty con-\\n cerning occupational safety, however, because occupational safety is not a\\n salient issue for most consumers, there is little public information about the\\n issue, and some firms with poor safety records do not sell goods or serv-\\n ices directly to the public.\\n (iv) Voluntary compliance with occupational safety and health standards\\n is more likely when there is a greater likelihood that employees will de-\\n mand and receive wage premiums. A firm\\'s incentive voluntarily to com-\\n ply is also related to the likelihood that it will have to pay its employees a\\n risk premium if it fails to protect them from work-related risks. The reality\\n is that some workers receive compensation for some risks, but many (per-\\n haps most) workers do not receive wage premiums that fully compensate\\n them for occupational risks. Thus, OSHA can expect more voluntary com-\\n pliance, all other things being equal, when labor markets are not subject to\\n the types of defects that limit the ability and capacity of workers to obtain\\n wage premiums. In particular, OSHA should be wary of relying on volun-\\n tary compliance when workers are likely to have little knowledge about oc-\\n cupational risks, are likely to misunderstand the degree of risk, or are likely\\n to lack the bargaining power necessary to act on their knowledge. 167\\n (v) Voluntary compliance is more likely when there are clear and wide-\\n spread social norms that compel protection of the environment, workers,\\n and consumers. A firm\\'s incentive to engage in voluntary compliance is\\n also related to the likelihood that it will have to pay its employees a reser-\\n vation pay premium if it fails to protect the environment, workers, or con-\\n sumers. There is only limited evidence, however, that firms with poor en-\\n vironmental or safety records are forced to pay these premiums.\\n Regulators should be wary of relying on voluntary compliance when the\\n public is unlikely to become aware of the lack of compliance, managers\\n lack professional training so are unlikely to internalize environmental or\\n safety norms, or the corporate (or industry) culture resists compliance.168\\n 166. See supra note 108 and accompanying text.\\n 167. See supra notes 112-115 and accompanying text.\\n 168. See supra notes 140, 149-161 and accompanying text.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n VOLUNTARY REGULA TORY COMPLIANCE\\n \\n In particular, OSHA should be cautious about relying on voluntary compli-\\n ance in response to social norms because few social norms regarding the\\n protection of workers appear strong enough to induce such voluntary ac-\\n tion. Social norms are weak because society sends mixed signals regarding\\n the responsibility for protecting workers.\\'69\\n (vi) Voluntary compliance is more likely when it results in immediate\\n cost savings than future cost savings. A firm\\'s incentive to engage in vol-\\n untary compliance is related to how quickly protective activities generate\\n cost savings. Managers will discount future savings because of the time\\n value of money. Discounting also reflects the uncertainty that future cost\\n savings will actually occur. As a result, the amount of future cost reduc-\\n tions must be larger than the reduction of current costs to justify the same\\n level of abatement. Thus, other things being equal, a firm is more likely to\\n engage in abatement that reduces the yearly cost of insurance and less\\n likely to engage in abatement that reduces the long-term negative impact on\\n consumer sales or stock market prices of having a poor safety record. This\\n effect suggests voluntary compliance is more likely for immediate, acute\\n hazards than for chronic, latent harms.\\n (vii) A concerted enforcement program, where feasible, is more likely to\\n protect the environment, workers, or consumers than voluntary compli-\\n ance. Congress adopted environmental and safety and health legislation\\n because voluntary compliance did not produce adequate protection. It re-\\n mains true that a concerted enforcement program, where feasible, is more\\n likely to protect the environment, workers, or consumers than voluntary\\n compliance. A firm will react to economic incentives, but the various in-\\n centives discussed above may or may not operate in a given circumstance.\\n An injured worker, for example, may fail to file a workers\\' compensation\\n claim or may fail to recover compensation although entitled to it. When\\n OSHA promulgates a regulation, by comparison, the level of compliance\\n does not depend on whether other incentives to protect workers actually\\n operate consistent with economic theory. Instead, compliance depends on\\n the probability OSHA will detect a violation and the size of the fine it im-\\n poses. OSHA can compel compliance if it is able to engage in frequent in-\\n spections and impose large fines (or a jail sentence) for violations. OSHA\\n regulation will compel less compliance in circumstances where such a con-\\n certed enforcement program is not feasible because of resource limitations\\n or the lack of legal authority to impose large fines (or jail sentences).\\n 169.

Small Firms and Regulatory Compliance\\n Besides the previous factors, the firm size in an industry is another im-\\n portant predictor of voluntary compliance. For example, an industry whose\\n output or employment is dominated by small employers is less likely. to\\n protect workers voluntarily than an industry composed primarily of large\\n firms.70 More generally, empirical studies have correlated company size\\n with the likelihood a firm will participate in voluntary compliance pro-\\n grams administered by EPA.171\\n One reason company size correlates with voluntary regulatory compli-\\n ance is that the incentives identified are stronger for large firms and may\\n not exist for small businesses. First, smaller businesses lack the economies\\n of scale available to large firms in the use of abatement technologies.172\\n Since the likelihood that a firm will undertake abatement is a function of its\\n abatement costs, higher compliance costs make it less likely that small\\n firms will take preventative actions. Second, as noted, workers\\' compen-\\n sation premiums for small employers are not experience rated because they\\n have too few employees.73 Third, as Haines\\' research suggests, small\\n firms are less likely to act virtuously in response to workplace accidents\\n and safety issues than larger companies because they are in a weaker busi-\\n ness position.74 Finally, small firms may lack the resources to employ pro-\\n fessionals who may have internalized safety norms.\\n Regulation also provides less incentive for small firms to protect work-\\n ers. Very small firms can disregard OSHA enforcement because Congress\\n has forbidden OSHA to inspect firms employing ten or fewer persons.175\\n When small firms are subject to inspection, OSHA enforcement reduces\\n penalties based on firm size.176 Small firms are also less likely to reduce\\n market costs associated with enforcement if they engage in abatement.\\n Most small companies are not publicly owned, so announcement of OSHA\\n penalties will not cause a decline in the value of their stock.

Small firms\\n also suffer less reputational cost as compared to large firms.\\'\\n It is therefore no surprise that studies of the relationship between size\\n and the incidence of occupational injuries indicate small firms expose their\\n employees to much higher risks of on-the-job injuries.78 Simply, the cost\\n to small businesses of failing to protect workers is less than costs to larger\\n firms, and they therefore have less incentive to react to regulatory and non-\\n regulatory incentives.\\n C. Private Standards and Voluntary Regulatory Compliance\\n We noted earlier that trade associations and professional groups identify\\n potential hazards and issue recommendations on risk reduction.\\'79 Many\\n such recommendations are widely available in industries to which they\\n pertain.

Print 1971).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA WREVIEW\\n \\n Private standards, as..noted earlier, might prompt voluntary compliance\\n because they lower a firm\\'s abatement costs. In the OSHA context, such\\n standards alert firms to potential occupational hazards and recommend re-\\n sponsive actions. 82 At the same time, a private standard may increase the\\n cost to a firm of failing to take preventative actions in several ways.\\n 1. Potential Impact of Private Standards\\n A private standard can increase a firm\\'s regulatory costs if its violation\\n is negligent. Because of this potential liability, firms may adhere to the\\n standard before the courts adopt it as the standard of care.183       Because\\n workers\\' compensation does not use a fault standard, a private standard\\n would not operate in this fashion in claims between employers and their\\n employees.\\' 8\\n 182. See infra notes 188-194 and accompanying text.\\n 183. According to Professor Baram, private standards will have this impact when \"the\\n technologies and the risks involved are well understood, and the potential liability ... is sig-\\n nificant enough to force a responsible industrial approach to reducing risks through volun-\\n tary standards.\" By comparison, \"experience offers little to support the notion that private\\n standards would be an efficacious approach to certain risks (for example, of toxic chemi-\\n cals) when such conditions were not present.\" BARAM ET AL., supra note 10, at 56.\\n 184. OSHA, however, may be able to enforce a private standard under the \"general duty\\n clause\" of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which requires an employer to protect\\n workers against \"recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious\\n physical harm.\" 29 U.S.C. .§ 654(a)(1) (1994). An employer violates the general duty\\n clause when it has constructive notice of a danger and there is a practicable method for\\n abating the hazard. See National Realty & Constr. Co. v. Occupational Safety & Health Re-\\n view Comm\\'n, 489 F.2d 1257, 1265 n.32, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 1973). An employer has con-\\n structive knowledge when the existence of a hazard is \"recognized\" in an industry. A haz-\\n ard is recognized when it is \"common knowledge of safety experts who are familiar with the\\n circumstances of the industry or the activity in question.\" Id. at 1265 n.32. The courts have\\n held private standards, industry publications, and manufacturer\\'s warnings, among other\\n sources, can demonstrate that a hazard was recognized in an industry. See MARK A.\\n ROTHSTEIN, OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW §§ 122-123, 185 (3d ed. 1990);\\n OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH LAW § 122-123 (Stephen A. Bokat & Horace A.\\n Thompson III eds., 1988). OSHA also takes the position that a health hazard is recognized\\n if a substance is deemed hazardous by nationally recognized standards-setting associations.\\n See id. at 123. The potential impact of the general duty clause, however, is limited. Em-\\n ployers can prevent OSHA from enforcing a private standard under the general duty clause\\n by disputing the scientific basis for it. See, e.g., Secretary of Labor v. Kastalon, Inc., 12\\n O.S.H. Cas. 1928 (BNA) (Rev. Comm., July 23, 1986). Moreover, even when OSHA can\\n establish that a hazard is recognized, it must prove the feasibility of abatement measures on\\n a case-by-case basis. See Pepperidge Farms, 17 O.S.H. Cas. 1993, 2003 (BNA) (Rev.\\n Comm., Apr. 26 1997). This heightened standard of proof means general duty clause litiga-\\n tion is resource-intensive and likely to be initiated too infrequently to create long-lasting\\n incentives.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n VOLUNTARY REGULA TORY COMPLIANCE\\n \\n Private standards can also increase a firm\\'s market and labor costs. If\\n the publication of a private standard prompts consumers at some point to\\n boycott firms that fail to adhere to the standard, or favor firms that do com-\\n ply, the failure of a firm to conform to the standard will raise its market\\n costs.\\'85 If the standard alerts workers to unabated workplace risks, the\\n firm might have to pay a wage premium to compensate the workers for the\\n firm\\'s failure to prevent the hazard.86 If a private standard operates as a\\n protective norm, the failure of a firm to comply with the standard may\\n cause distress or discomfort for firm managers. The reputation of a firm\\'s\\n safety officers, for example, may suffer if it fails to comply with widely ac-\\n cepted professional standards concerning occupational safety. This should\\n lead to demands by the officers for a reservation wage premium for the rea-\\n sons discussed earlier.87\\n 2. Actual Impact of Private Standards\\n Although a firm\\'s failure to comply with a private standard can increase\\n its costs in several ways, available evidence suggests that private standards\\n do not prompt significant voluntary regulatory compliance. Moreover,\\n even if there is compliance, private standards typically offer limited pro-\\n tection for the environment, workers, and consumers.\\n a. Level of Compliance\\n Despite the potential of private standards to prompt firms to comply vol-\\n untarily, OSHA\\'s experience indicates that they often do not do so. Before\\n Congress created OSHA, it was aware that private consensus organizations\\n had developed approximately thirteen percent of the then existing safety\\n standards, and that proprietary organizations had adopted an extensive set\\n of toxic exposure limits.88 Seeking to take advantage of these private\\n standards, Congress directed OSHA to promulgate them as mandatory\\n regulations, without notice and comment, unless doing so would not im-\\n prove worker safety and health.I9 Shortly after OSHA was created in 1971,\\n 185. See supra notes 80-89 and accompanying text (discussing potential for consumer\\n boycotts and preferences).\\n 186. See supra notes 109-123 and accompanying text (discussing potential for wage\\n premiums).\\n 187. See supra notes 124-133 and accompanying text (discussing potential for reserva-\\n tion pay premiums).\\n 188. See SENATE SUBCOMM. ON LABOR OF THE COMM. ON LABOR AND PUBLIC WELFARE,\\n 1 ST SESS., LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT OF 1970\\n (S. 2193, P.L. 91-596) 2-146 (Comm. Print 1971).\\n 189. 29 U.S.C. § 655(a) (1,994).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n it adopted hundreds of private standards pursuant to this requirement.90\\n When OSHA sought to enforce the formerly private standards soon after\\n they were adopted as mandatory requirements, it found widespread non-\\n compliance.\\'9\\' This experience suggests the formerly private standards did\\n not create sufficient incentives for employers voluntarily to comply. In-\\n deed, OSHA still finds noncompliance, indicating that none of the incen-\\n tives identified in our model together are sufficient to prompt compliance\\n with these formerly private, and now regulatory, standards.192\\n There is more evidence that firms do not react to private standards. In\\n 1989, OSHA attempted to update its toxic exposure limits by substituting\\n new private standards for the out-of-date limits then in effect.\\'93 OSHA\\n standards were out of date because they were based on private standards\\n that OSHA adopted in 1971 in response to a legislative mandate. Because\\n OSHA had failed to update the 1971 regulations, modem private standards\\n required greater protection. To build a record for the adoption of the more\\n protective recent private standards, OSHA conducted a compliance survey.\\n It found that fifty-nine percent of firms surveyed complied with OSHA\\'s\\n out-of-date regulations, while twenty-two percent of the firms voluntarily\\n adopted the newer, more protective private standards.94 In other words,\\n the newer, more protective private standards had prompted only about one-\\n fifth of the firms surveyed to engage in more protection than they were le-\\n gally required to do.\\n The lack of compliance may appear surprising in cases where private\\n standards are enforced by a trade association. Presumably, a firm that fails\\n to comply with an industry or professional standard faces an additional cost\\n -  loss of membership in a trade or professional association -  which itself\\n should spur compliance.95 Yet, the prospect that trade or professional as-\\n sociations will revoke membership for failure to comply with voluntary\\n standards appears remote.96 In 1988, for example, the Chemical Manu-\\n 190. These standards still form the bulk of OSHA regulatory requirements.\\n 191. In its early years, OSHA issued several hundred thousand violations per year. See\\n FREDERICK B. SISKiND, TWENTY YEARS OF OSHA ENFORCEMENT, at Table 4 (1993).\\n 192. The OSH Review Commission recognized that many employers have difficulty\\n complying with consensus standards. See, e.g., Dun Par Engineered Form Co., 12 O.S.H.\\n Cas. 1949 (BNA) (Rev. Comm., July 30, 1986).\\n 193. Industry successfully blocked OSHA\\'s effort, objecting that the agency had not\\n adequately considered the economic impact of mandating compliance with these voluntary\\n standards. See AFL-CIO v. OSHA, 962 F.2d 965 (11th Cir. 1991).\\n 194. See 54 Fed. Reg. 2736 (1989).\\n 195. Presumably, firms join associations because they reap a benefit. Safety informa-\\n tion provided by an association, as noted earlier, is one such benefit. Loss of membership, if\\n likely, might be a significant cost of non-compliance with voluntary standards.\\n 196. An association is most likely to police a lack of compliance when self-regulation\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n VOLUNTARY REG ULA TORY COMPLIANCE\\n \\n facturers\\' Association (CMA) launched its Responsible Care Program. Re-\\n sponsible Care requires, as a condition of CMA membership, firms to im-\\n plement six environmental safety and health codes of practice.97 Firms,\\n however, self-report compliance198 and few CMA members have enrolled\\n in its voluntary third-party audit program.\\'99 Firms who lag behind on\\n compliance goals receive \"gentle reminders\" from CMA.°° We can find\\n no evidence that any CMA member has been expelled for failing to comply\\n with Responsible Care.\\n b. Level of Protection\\n Even when firms comply with private standards, they may provide lim-\\n ited protection for the environment, workers, and consumers. One problem\\n is that private standard-setting organizations tend to be \"business-oriented\"\\n and \"industry-dominated,20\\'1 and private standards therefore reflect \"the\\n lowest common denominator of acceptance by interested private\\n groups.\"202 Thus, while better than nothing, the level of protection that is\\n achieved is normally less than comparable rules adopted by regulatory\\n agencies. Another problem is that many industry codes do not require a\\n firm to achieve a particular level of protection. Instead, they obligate a\\n firm to establish systems to meet internal goals. Again, such standards\\n make a contribution to protecting the environment, workers, and consum-\\n ers, but because they do not require any specific level of protection, they\\n are unlikely to generate the level of protection that EPA or OSHA gener-\\n ally requires when it regulates.\\n enhances its reputation and, therefore, consumer demand for the industry\\'s products and\\n services. See Heidt, supra note 12, at 1556-57 (giving example that FTD\\'s exclusion of\\n member suspected of overcharging or providing for inferior flowers rests on potential dam-\\n age to group\\'s reputation and concomitant reduce in demand for group\\'s products).\\n 197.

First, Professor Hamilton found little non-industry rep-\\n resentation in the development of consensus standards,203 including very\\n limited participation by labor representatives in the development of work\\n place standards.2°4 Unions were reluctant to participate because they had\\n limited technical resources, and they anticipated committee decisions\\n would be dominated by management. Thus, unions were reluctant to give\\n legitimacy to the process in light of this domination.205 As one would pre-\\n dict, Hamilton could find no representation of non-unionized labor in the\\n consensus process. 206 Second, he found the industry-orientation of com-\\n mittees led them to balance the level of safety and health protection against\\n cost considerations:\\n Because [of] the ... industry orientation of most technical committees, the costs and\\n complexity of increased safety or purity will almost certainly be weighted more\\n heavily by these committees than by an individual whose primary concern is safety or\\n health .... The welter of legislative enactments vesting issues of safety or health in\\n the governmental agencies suggests that for most people the balance provided by the\\n private sector often fails to accommodate health or safety considerations satisfacto-\\n rily. 207\\n Shapiro and McGarity discuss the operation of industry influences on the\\n \"threshold limit values\" developed by the American Conference of Gov-\\n ernmental and Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH).208 They note that ACGIH\\n standards in many cases provide limited protection for workers because in-\\n dustry-dominated committees are more reluctant than OSHA to character-\\n ize a substance as a carcinogen and less likely to rely on published scien-\\n tific data instead of industry supplied information.09\\n When standards set by private organizations are perceived as having\\n regulatory implications, consensus becomes harder to reach. ACGIH de-\\n layed a vote on lowering its recommended exposure limit for formaldehyde\\n after the industry trade association threatened a lawsuit.210 Similarly, in-\\n dustry opponents to ergonomics regulation have raised procedural objec-\\n 203.

By com-\\n parison, other standards simply recommend that firms adopt a management\\n process integrating environmental or other social concerns. For example,\\n CMA\\'s Responsible Care program, discussed earlier, does not impose\\n quantitative performance standards.   Instead, as Jody Freeman notes,\\n \"compliance... commits firms only to management practices and internal\\n accountability mechanisms (such as auditing and reporting) which are de-\\n signed to integrate environmental considerations into every aspect of firm\\n decision making, from production design through distribution and sale.\\'213\\n The same is true for the international environmental standards published by\\n the Institute for Standards Organization (ISO) in Geneva, which are a set of\\n environmental management standards.14 Compliance with the ISO\\'s\\n 14000 series of standards is widely cited as a good illustration of voluntary\\n regulatory compliance.215 Yet, like Responsible Care, the adoption of an\\n environmental management standard satisfying ISO 14000 \"is not a com-\\n mitment to achieving specific performance standards.216\\n III. OPTIONS TO INCREASE VOLUNTARY REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\\n A firm will reduce occupational safety and health risks as long as it is\\n reducing the sum of its abatement, regulatory, and market costs.

This section considers how agencies can\\n strengthen existing incentives to protect the environment, workers, and\\n consumers. In light of the cost-minimization model, regulators can in-\\n crease a firm\\'s protective incentives by reducing its abatement costs or in-\\n creasing it regulatory or market costs. This section considers information,\\n regulatory, and third-party strategies that potentially have this impact.\\n A. Information Strategies\\n Regulators may induce additional voluntary compliance by providing in-\\n formation of three types. First, they can provide information about risks\\n and prevention. Second, they can provide abatement strategies, which\\n should lower a firm\\'s abatement costs. Third, regulators can provide in-\\n formation to the public about a firm\\'s level of compliance with existing\\n regulations. This may stimulate public and market pressure for firms to\\n raise their compliance levels. This section describes and evaluates these\\n approaches in the OSHA context.\\n 1. Risk Information\\n OSHA has experimented with a variety of information solutions, pro-\\n viding employers and employees with information about hazards and con-\\n trols when regulations are not in place. The most significant source of haz-\\n ard information is provided by manufacturers of chemicals who are\\n required, under OSHA\\'s hazard communication standard, to provide mate-\\n rial safety data sheets (MSDS) describing chemical hazards and to label\\n chemical containers with warnings about health effects.217 These warnings\\n must be provided even if employee exposure may be below levels viewed\\n as hazardous.218\\n There is another method for OSHA to provide risk information. To\\n regulate, OSHA must compile information about the risk posed by a hazard\\n and how to mitigate it. Since rulemaking is time-consuming, this informa-\\n tion may be available for some period of time before it is used to support\\n the promulgation of a rule. OSHA might be able to prompt greater worker\\n protection by publishing risk and abatement information when it is re-\\n ceived. In other words, OSHA might engage in segmented rulemaking:\\n publishing risk and abatement information in one phase and using this in-\\n formation to write and defend a rule in the next phase. This section consid-\\n ers the potential impact of the publication of risk information. The next\\n 217. See29C.F.R. § 1910.1200(1998).\\n 218. See Durez Div. of Occidental Chem. Corp. v. OSHA, 906 F.2d I (D.C. Cir. 1990)\\n (stating manufacturers must warn of chemical hazards without regard to the likely exposure\\n level of downstream employee users).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n VOLUNTARY REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\\n \\n section considers the potential impact of the publication of abatement in-\\n formation.\\n A firm\\'s abatements costs include the search costs necessary to identify\\n potential risks. By alerting employers about current scientific information\\n concerning a risk, OSHA may reduce a firm\\'s abatement costs. As noted\\n earlier, the lower a firm\\'s abatement costs, the more likely that it will en-\\n gage in voluntary compliance.\"9 A firm, however, would still need to in-\\n cur abatement expenses, which may discourage it from voluntarily acting to\\n protect workers, particularly if abatement costs are significant. Thus, it is\\n unknown whether merely providing risk information will result in addi-\\n tional voluntary compliance.\\n The provision of risk information may also spur voluntary compliance if\\n it empowers workers to obtain additional wage premiums. Risk compen-\\n sation, as explained earlier, provides an incentive for employers to reduce\\n workplace hazards,220 but workers require information about workplace\\n risks to seek such compensation. If OSHA published and circulated risk\\n assessments as they became available, it might reduce this problem.\\n Whether the publication of risk assessments would lead to additional risk\\n compensation, and hence, create an incentive to reduce risks, depends on\\n other conditions in a labor market. The absence of information is not the\\n only impediment that prevents employees from obtaining wages that fully\\n compensate them for occupational risks,22\\' and no empirical evidence\\n shows the extent to which increased information spurs employers voluntar-\\n ily to reduce employee exposure.222 OSHA anticipated that promulgation\\n of the hazard communication standard would \"produce market-oriented re-\\n sponses by employers and employees that translate into lower incidence of\\n chemically-related injury and illness on the job. .. .  but no evaluation of\\n actual benefits from hazard disclosure has been made.\\n Finally, publication of risk information can lead to general duty clause\\n enforcement actions. Since the general duty clause requires employers to\\n protect workers from recognized hazards, policy statements describing un-\\n regulated hazards and recommending corrective action can trigger general\\n duty clause compliance obligations.224 When relying on the general duty\\n 219.

Of course, each general\\n duty clause prosecution requires OSHA to prove the existence of a hazard.\\n When OSHA promulgates a standard, the existence of a hazard is pre-\\n sumed. 226\\n In summary, OSHA\\'s situation suggests the publication of risk informa-\\n tion may have limited efficacy in some (or even many) situations, but the\\n availability of such information may assist, and is unlikely to harm, work-\\n ers. In addition, the publication and circulation of risk information should\\n be relatively inexpensive for OSHA. Similarly, other agencies should be\\n able to disseminate to the public readily available risk information.\\n Moreover, as long as an agency reserves the right to change a risk assess-\\n ment at a later time, the courts should consider the assessment to be a pol-\\n icy statement. 22  Thus, the agency does not have to use notice-and-\\n comment rulemaking to issue the assessment228 and it is not subject to judi-\\n cial review.229\\n 2. Abatement Information\\n Besides risk identification information, agencies can also publicize\\n abatement information. By providing this type of information, an agency\\n can lower a firm\\'s prevention costs and make it more likely that a firm will\\n protect the environment, workers, and consumers without the spur of regu-\\n (O.S.H.R.C., June 19, 1995).\\n 225.

The agency might pur-\\n sue this option in cases where it has identified appropriate abatement, but\\n the completion of a rulemaking is likely to be delayed.\\n Like the publication of risk information, however, this strategy may have\\n limited efficacy. In the past, publication of guidelines has not induced sub-\\n stantial compliance with OSHA\\'s goals. For example, before OSHA\\n promulgated a standard regulating exposure to bloodborne pathogens, the\\n Centers for Disease Control had published guidelines governing the same\\n topic. An OSHA survey found compliance rates varied widely among af-\\n fected health care sectors.233 Moreover, even if some employers follow the\\n guidelines, OSHA\\'s experience suggests it has little power to force em-\\n ployers who lag behind to take preventive action.234 Potential general duty\\n clause citations create some incentive for employers to abide by guidelines.\\n But, where employers perceive the guidelines as imposing compliance ob-\\n ligations, as they do when used as the basis for general duty clause cita-\\n tions, they will oppose publication of the guidelines.235  While OSHA le-\\n 230. See supra note 23 and accompanying text (indicating compliance costs include in-\\n formation costs).\\n 231. OSHA has published guidelines for protecting employees from violence in the\\n night retail and health care sectors. In the mid-1980s, when OSHA first began citing em-\\n ployers for ergonomic hazards, OSHA published meatpacking guidelines. These guidelines\\n described recommended approaches for employers to abate ergonomic hazards.\\n 232. NIOSH publishes current intelligence bulletins that alert employers to new scien-\\n tific information indicating serious workplace hazards and recommends control strategies.\\n 233. See Occupational Exposure to Bloodbome Pathogens, 56 Fed. Reg. 64,004, 64,060\\n (1991) (to be codified at 29 C.F.R. pt. 1010, 1030). Compliance variations were noted even\\n though health care professional\\'s failure to follow these infection control procedures could\\n result in malpractice liability to patients. Compliance was highest in hospitals and much\\n lower in small medical or dental offices.\\n 234. Congress recognized that some employers would not take preventive action unless\\n all were required to do so and required the promulgation of standards to avoid placing em-\\n ployers who protect employees at a competitive disadvantage compared with employers\\n who fail to take preventive action.\\n 235. See, e.g., Second Round of Night Retail Comments Suggests More Focused Re-\\n search Needed, 26 O.S.H. Rep. (BNA) (O.S.H. Cas.) 614 (Sept. 9, 1996).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n gaily may publish such guidelines without employer participation, active\\n opposition by interested stakeholders decreases the likelihood that they will\\n engender compliance. If OSHA seeks employer input, the staff resources\\n needed to prepare for and coordinate public meetings and incorporate\\n stakeholder suggestions might be better used to develop regulatory propos-\\n als.\\n A more promising strategy may be for OSHA to engage in post-\\n rulemaking consultation about compliance. After OSHA promulgates a\\n standard, it can hasten compliance by providing technical assistance to em-\\n ployers before the effective date for implementation of engineering controls\\n arises. Because OSHA must cite violations of standards it observes,236 its\\n ability to provide technical assistance to employers once a standard has be-\\n come effective is limited. After the effective date of a standard, consultants\\n provide compliance assistance.237\\n 3. Compliance Information\\n A firm that fails to prevent environmental or other accidents may incur\\n two potentially significant, but difficult to measure, costs. The firm may\\n incur higher market costs if retail customers boycott its products as a form\\n of social protest,238 or industrial customers may make alternative purchas-\\n ing arrangements because they regard the firm as an unreliable source of\\n supply.239 The firm also incurs opportunity costs if it fails to attract con-\\n sumers willing to pay a premium for products produced by socially respon-\\n sible companies.240 The firm may have higher capital costs if investors re-\\n gard its failure as an indication of a future loss of earnings.241\\n Agencies can potentially increase these costs by using two types of pub-\\n licity. They can publicize the names of firms who do not comply with\\n regulations to raise the market and social costs associated with their poor\\n performance. They can also recognize firms with superior performance to\\n stimulate the market rewards associated with environmental, worker, and\\n consumer protection. The effects of publicity require a pre-existing regu-\\n 236. See Shapiro & Rabinowitz, supra note 28, at 732-37.\\n 237. Occupational Safety & Health Administration Compliance Assistance Authoriza-\\n tion Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-197, 112 Stat. 638 (1998) (to be codified at 29 U.S.C.\\n §§ 651 note 670).\\n 238.

Thus, publicity is not a substitute for regula-\\n tion, but a means of supplementing compliance with rules, particularly in\\n circumstances where enforcement is unlikely.\\n OSHA has some experience with publicity effects. When it issues cita-\\n tions with large penalties, OSHA often issues press releases announcing its\\n actions. Newspapers often report these large penalty assessments. OSHA\\n also recognizes firms with the best safety and health performance through\\n its Voluntary Protection Program (VPP).\\n OSHA can extend these efforts by publishing a yearly index or listing of\\n those employers that have the best and worst compliance records. This ef-\\n fort could be modeled on EPA\\'s toxic release inventory, and the ranking\\n could be based on a firm\\'s compliance and worker\\'s compensation record.\\n In devising a ranking scheme, OSHA should adopt procedures to ensure the\\n accuracy of its information and protect firms from unfair injury.242\\n The ranking of firms could be combined with a challenge to poorly per-\\n forming firms to do better. Former EPA General Counsel, Donald Elliot,\\n endorses this approach because it offers \"positive rewards - as opposed to\\n negative threats - in terms of public recognition\" and provides \"useful\\n tools in the form of information, but not mandating the details of how to\\n achieve pollution reduction\\'\\'243 Elliot cites a government report that finds\\n firms identified as significant polluters in the EPA\\'s Toxic Release Inven-\\n tory have undertaken voluntary pollution control programs to gain \"im-\\n proved public acceptance.244\\n Elliot\\'s endorsement of challenge programs assumes that market incen-\\n tives are sufficient to encourage firms to act in the manner he describes.\\n While there are numerous examples of such behavior, our analysis reveals\\n there is no firm evidence linking such incentives to voluntary prevention\\n efforts.245 Moreover, as noted earlier, the fact that businesses respond to\\n publicity -  favorable or unfavorable -  by increasing environmental pro-\\n tection does not necessarily mean that they will act in the same manner\\n concerning publicity about occupational safety and health.246 Still, the con-\\n 242.

See supra notes 90-92 and accompanying text (discussing significance of market\\n incentives). In a footnote, Elliot admits that some observers are \"skeptical\" about the extent\\n to which challenge programs have reduced pollution, contending, among other arguments,\\n that claimed reductions are spurious or would have been made anyway for other reasons.\\n Elliot, supra note 11, at 1843 n.15.\\n 246. See supra note 93 and accompanying text (discussing why firms may have less in-\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n cept of a challenge program offers an organized way for OSHA to build on\\n the concept of positive and negative publicity to attempt to gain greater\\n protection of workers. Since challenge programs have had at least some\\n success in the environmental field, OSHA might experiment with similar\\n approaches.\\n B. Regulatory Strategies\\n Regulators may be able to publish information in a manner that creates\\n incentives for firms to engage in voluntary compliance. They also can em-\\n ploy four regulatory strategies that might have a beneficial impact. In each\\n strategy, the agency agrees to make some concession in return for which\\n employers agree to engage in voluntary compliance. For example, an\\n agency can agree to postpone rulemaking (or the promulgation of a rule) if\\n regulated entities agree to engage in certain specified protective activities.\\n Alternatively, an agency can agree to vary regulatory requirements as part\\n of a bargain with a firm or group of firms to engage in protection activities.\\n Or an agency might empower intermediate institutions to implement vol-\\n untary regulatory compliance. An agency also can (and already does) trade\\n reduced penalties for an agreement by a regulated entity to undertake vol-\\n untary compliance activities. Finally, where feasible, an agency can seek\\n to make regulatory compliance a precondition for government contracting.\\n This section describes and evaluates these approaches in the OSHA con-\\n text.\\n 1. Postponing Rulemaking\\n Businesses engage in voluntary compliance as a strategy to forestall\\n government regulation (or more stringent regulation) that they perceive\\n would be more costly.247 The willingness of an industry to take such ac-\\n tions opens the door for OSHA or other agencies to bargain for this result.\\n For example, an industry may want to avoid having its product labeled a\\n carcinogen. To avoid this finding, it might voluntarily agree to protect the\\n environment, the public, or workers. In this manner, an industry may post-\\n pone a government finding that its product is hazardous while workers re-\\n ceive needed protections. OSHA\\'s recent agreement with the fiberglass in-\\n dustry illustrates the potential of this strategy. Some observers believe\\n fiberglass is as hazardous to respiratory health as asbestos,248 but fiberglass\\n centive to respond to publicity concerning workplace safety and health).\\n 247. See supra notes 67-68 and accompanying text (discussing business strategy of fore-\\n stalling regulation).\\n 248. Peter Perl & Li Fellers, Breathing Uneasy, WASH. POST, June 22, 1997 (Magazine),\\n at 14.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n VOLUNTARY REG ULA TORY COMPLIANCE\\n \\n manufacturers dispute this claim and have gone to great lengths to avoid\\n the cancer label. To avoid threatened OSHA regulation, the industry\\n agreed to a voluntary program to reduce workplace exposures.149\\n The problem with this strategy is that it is likely to result in less protec-\\n tion of workers than the level of protection mandated by an OSHA regula-\\n tion. After all, the employers\\' incentive is to obtain lower abatement costs\\n than they would have incurred under an OSHA regulation. Moreover, un-\\n less OSHA can mount a credible threat that it will regulate unless an in-\\n dustry agrees to engage in voluntary compliance, it may be difficult to get\\n industry agreement to engage in any additional protection of workers.\\n 2. Regulatory Variances\\n Agencies may also be able to induce firms to engage in voluntary regu-\\n latory compliance if they agree to regulatory variances in return for a\\n commitment to engage in certain specified protective actions. EPA\\'s\\n \"Project XL\" is often cited as a good example of the benefits of this form\\n of collaboration.250 EPA established Project XL (eXcellence and Leader-\\n ship) in 1995 to provide regulated entities \"the opportunity to develop and\\n implement alternative strategies to produce superior environmental per-\\n formance.25\\'\\n Under Project XL, an applicant commits itself to exceed current emis-\\n sions regulations in return for which EPA alters regulatory requirements to\\n reduce the company\\'s compliance costs.252 For example, EPA may ap-\\n prove a single comprehensive permit instead of requiring multiple permits\\n that the applicant would otherwise have to submit to obtain regulatory per-\\n mission to pollute the air or water.253 The goal is to reduce regulatory costs\\n and pollution by adopting \"customized\" protection strategies for individual\\n facilities.254 To gain EPA approval of proposals, applicants must involve\\n local stakeholders, including state and local governments and environ-\\n 249. See Enforcement: OSHA Settles Poultry Plant Citations; Closes Book on Biggest\\n Ergonomics Case, 28 O.S.H. Rep. (BNA) (O.S.H.

The critics claim that EPA\\n failed to attract significant industry support, has not placated its \"most\\n powerful critics\" in Congress, and has not obtained the endorsement of\\n most environmental groups.\"258 EPA itself has admitted frustration with\\n the pace of Project XL. The agency confessed that the project has attracted\\n fewer applications than it expected, the applicants have proposed fewer in-\\n novations than EPA had hoped, the approval process has taken longer than\\n expected, and the project lacks clear legal authority to adopt some propos-\\n als.259\\n The basis of Project XL -  modification of EPA\\'s permit process - can\\n not be replicated at OSHA where regulated entities are not required to ap-\\n ply for permits before workers are exposed to occupational risks. OSHA,\\n however, does have the authority to vary the requirements of standards, so\\n long as employee protections are not reduced.260 OSHA rarely uses its\\n variance authority, perhaps because formal proceedings are required. Nev-\\n ertheless, OSHA could use its variance authority to modify specific com-\\n pliance obligations to better suit particular industry categories. Similarly, it\\n can use its authority to grant variances to groups, not individual firms,\\n meeting specified criteria.26\\'\\n OSHA has another option to vary compliance requirements. When\\n OSHA promulgates a standard, it predicts the technology that the industry\\n will use to comply and its cost. The accuracy of that prediction varies, de-\\n pending on the detail of OSHA\\'s feasibility analysis during rulemaking.262\\n 255. See EPA, Regulatory Reinvention (XL) Pilot Projects, 62 Fed.

OSHA once used the variance authority to grant waivers to large segments of an\\n affected industry when the burden of implementing the medical removal protection portions\\n of its lead standard threatened firm\\'s staffing levels. See 46 Fed. Reg. 37891 (1981) (to be\\n codified at 29 C.F.R. pt. 1910); 46 Fed. Reg. 38074 (1981) (to be codified at 29 C.F.R. pt.\\n 1910).\\n 262. See United Steelworkers of Am. v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1267, 1270 (D.C. Cir.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n VOLUNTARY REG ULA TORY COMPLIANCE\\n \\n Instead of attempting to find a level of protection that is feasible for every\\n firm subject to a regulation, OSHA could simply issue a regulation that not\\n all firms can meet in all operations.263 It could then work with labor and\\n industry to develop compliance manuals that describe feasible control op-\\n tions for various operations. Agreed upon control strategies impose lower\\n information costs on employers. They also limit OSHA\\'s ability in the en-\\n forcement arena to insist on controls other than those described. In this\\n way, once a standard is in place, OSHA negotiates with the industry on\\n specific compliance strategies. OSHA tried this approach to resolve com-\\n pliance issues after the lead standard was affirmed.264 Labor and industry\\n requested that OSHA use this approach to implement the methylene chlo-\\n ride standard, but so far OSHA has not done so.\\n If OSHA varies the technical requirements of standards using the previ-\\n ous methods, industry would have less reason to fight inclusion of such\\n detail in standards. Now, however, the prospect of getting a variance is\\n slim, so details in OSHA standards portend compliance difficulties even for\\n firms who take protective actions.\\n 3. Intermediary Institutions\\n Professor Jody Freedman proposes that OSHA rely on \"intermediate in-\\n stitutions\" as another method of promoting voluntary compliance.265 As an\\n example, she discusses the potential of a certification program under which\\n OSHA would certify companies for steel erection on the basis of a number\\n of criteria, including worker training and safety precautions.266 Under this\\n approach, Freedman notes, OSHA would\\n 1980).\\n 263. See id. at 1266.\\n 264. See 27 OSH Current Report 244 (July 23, 1997) (describing cooperative compli-\\n ance program under OSHA\\'s lead standard).\\n 265. Freeman, supra note 18, at 31.\\n 266. See id. at 52. According to Freeman:\\n A certification scheme might look something like this: certification is performed by\\n an independent auditor like the AISE or by the OSHA. To be certified, companies\\n would have to guarantee that they can meet a standard of safety. The standard might\\n simply be a best practice standard that promises \"to provide both security and mobil-\\n ity for workers.\" Certification would also require the company to file a safety plan\\n detailing worker training, safety practices, and the quality of the steel used on the job,\\n among other things. Companies that are incapable of meeting the standard would\\n have to explain why and embark on a mandatory improvement program. The OSHA\\n could require companies capable of meeting the standard to share information with\\n those that could not. Debates over safety factors and the considerations that ought to\\n be taken into account in the certification scheme would then be the focus of discus-\\n sion rather than inflexible, numerical tie-off rules.\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n play a number of roles in this imagined scheme: convening relevant parties, requiring\\n and facilitating information exchange, and certifying plans or accrediting the inde-\\n pendent certifiers. The agency could establish criteria for certifying bodies to meet\\n and set minimal safety floors by dictating the minimal elements required of any pro-\\n posed safety plan. It could retain ultimate authority to impose more stringent regula-\\n tions if the certification scheme failed to produce desired safety levels, which could\\n be closely monitored through mandatory disclosure of fatal and nonfatal injury\\n rates.267\\n Certification, or other similar \"intermediary institutions\" would be a use-\\n ful adjunct to traditional standards if their implementation required fewer\\n resources than traditional rulemaking and if they provided the same or\\n greater level of protection for workers. OSHA would have to commit the\\n resources necessary to develop a generic certification rule. After the rule\\n was promulgated, it could then invite industries or groups of firms to pro-\\n pose specific certification programs, which would save the agencies from\\n the necessity of developing such plans, at least initially. The real potential\\n for cost savings exists in using certification in lieu of traditional standards\\n in multiple situations.\\n EPA\\'s experience with Project XL, however, suggests OSHA should be\\n cautious about how easily it can implement certification. First, as with\\n Project XL, regulated entities will participate only if this approach prom-\\n ises recognizable cost savings. This may require OSHA to prove the \"effi-\\n cacy\" of this alternative to drum up interest in it.268  Second, like EPA,\\n OSHA should involve stakeholders in the development of any plan, which\\n may be difficult in contexts where employees are represented by unions.\\n Third, OSHA, like EPA, would have to verify that proposed programs of-\\n fered sufficient levels of protection, which may not be easy to do.\\n 4. Reducing Penalties\\n OSHA, like other regulators, can (and already does) induce additional\\n compliance by reducing penalties it has levied against an employer in re-\\n turn for the firm\\'s agreement to undertake additional actions to protect\\n workers.269 OSHA has successfully persuaded cited employers to agree to\\n 267. See id. at 53.\\n 268. Critics of Project XL attribute the lack of industry interest to EPA\\'s failure to dem-\\n onstrate the potential savings to industry of this approach. See, e.g, Steinzor, supra note 16,\\n at 201 (commenting that industry views Project XL as \"marginally relevant\" to its short- and\\n long-term goals because of the absence of \"convincing\" evidence that such voluntary efforts\\n save them money).\\n 269. To induce additional compliance, OSHA must have a rule in place or seek en-\\n forcement under the general duty clause. If it tries to pressure the industry to do more than\\n its regulations require, it will be viewed as regulating, and notice and comments are re-\\n quired. See Chamber of Commerce v. United States Dep\\'t of Labor, 174 F.3d 206 (D.C.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n VOLUNTARY REGULA TORY COMPLIANCE\\n \\n abate violations throughout a corporation in exchange for reduced penalties\\n and extended compliance schedules.270 This tactic can be particularly help-\\n ful when OSHA cites a firm under the general duty clause for failing to\\n protect workers from an unregulated hazard. The corporate-wide agree-\\n ment provides detailed compliance obligations to protect against hazards\\n for which no standard exists. OSHA was able to induce several major cor-\\n porations to adopt company-wide ergonomics programs to avoid plant-by-\\n plant citations under the general duty clause. This is a very resource inten-\\n sive strategy for controlling widespread hazards.\\n 5. Government Procurement\\n As a final regulatory option, agencies might attempt to establish regula-\\n tory compliance as a condition of government contracting. Since the\\n 1930s, the federal government has used its buying power to obtain a variety\\n of social and economic goals including the protection of workers.271 The\\n Walsh-Healy Act,272 enacted in the 1930s, requires contractors to comply\\n with safety and health standards recommended by the Bureau of Labor\\n Standards. In 1960, the Department of Labor (DOL) issued a set of man-\\n datory standards under Walsh-Healy, but DOL rarely used its inspection\\n authority and only a handful of contractors were ever debarred from further\\n contracting.273 In other areas where compliance with a legal norm is made\\n a condition for government contracting, the government has been reluctant\\n 274\\n to debar non-complying contractors.   Therefore, the threat of losing gov-\\n ernment contracts is so remote as to be unlikely to influence compliance.\\n However, a system where some penalty short of debarment can be im-\\n posed, such as providing less reimbursement to non-complying contractors,\\n might induce greater compliance because of the greater likelihood of impo-\\n Cir. 1998).\\n 270. See OSHA Instruction CPL 2.90 (describing corporate-wide settlement proce-\\n dures).\\n 271.

Resources needed to monitor contractor compliance would be\\n similar to those needed to inspect firms, so it is unclear what further ad-\\n vantage would result from such a system. Tying compliance to procure-\\n ment likely would be very controversial.275\\n The commitment of the federal government to promoting safety and\\n health in workplaces would have symbolic importance, which would help\\n promote a social norm of making the same commitment. As discussed ear-\\n lier, social norms can influence behavior, including the promotion of occu-\\n pational safety and health.276\\n OSHA should also consider how government procurement affects em-\\n ployers\\' compliance costs. In circumstances where an employer can obtain\\n reimbursement for its safety or health actions, OSHA should be able to ob-\\n tain a voluntary agreement from employers to take preventative actions.277\\n For example, federal contractors receive reimbursements for all bona\\n fide overhead expenses, such as regulatory compliance. Therefore, in-\\n creased compliance costs of federal contractors are passed forward to the\\n U.S. government. This suggests that where hazards affect employees of\\n government contractors, economic feasibility considerations are not as\\n great as with other hazards. Further, contractors can voluntarily agree to\\n increased protections for workers without adverse financial consequences if\\n the government accepts the costs as legitimate overhead expenses.\\n C. Third Party Solutions\\n As a final strategy, a regulator may be able to create incentives for pro-\\n tecting the environment, workers, and consumers by identifying firms with\\n an economic incentive to pressure other firms to protect the environment,\\n workers, or consumers. Until recently, for example, financial institutions\\n faced potentially massive liability for any toxic waste contamination for\\n which their debtors were potentially responsible parties under thee Com-\\n prehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act\\n (CERCLA). Faced with this threat, banks and other lending institutions\\n developed programs to assist their clients in adopting environmental man-\\n agement systems and in training their employees.278 This section discusses\\n the potential of such third party approaches in the OSHA context.\\n 275. See Administration Slated to Propose Linking Labor Law Compliance with Con-\\n tract Awards, 109 DAILY LABOR REP., June 8, 1999, at AA-I.\\n 276. See supra notes 124-33 and accompanying text (discussing role of social norms in\\n promoting compliance with legal rules).\\n 277. In such circumstances, the employers\\' abatement costs are reduced significantly,\\n which makes it more likely that a firm\\'s other costs will fall by more than the cost of abate-\\n ment.\\n 278. See Private Parties, Public Functions, supra note 17, at 35.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n VOLUNTARY REGULA TORY COMPLIANCE\\n \\n I. Tort Liability\\n The threat of tort liability creates incentives for firms to prevent acci-\\n dents and illnesses. Workers\\' compensation liability poses less threat be-\\n cause it does not fully compensate for injuries and employers insure against\\n such losses. The impact of tort law on employers is limited because work-\\n ers\\' compensation is exclusive. Tort law, however, still has an impact on\\n workplace safety and health. Third parties may be liable to injured or ill\\n workers in some situations. An employee, for example, may be able to sue\\n an equipment manufacturer for the faulty design of a machine that injured\\n the worker.79 Manufacturers who fail to warn employees of known toxic\\n dangers may face strict liability. A third party may have a greater incentive\\n to reduce a worker\\'s occupational risks than the person\\'s employer may\\n because the third party\\'s insurance premiums are more likely to be im-\\n pacted by the threat of tort liability.280\\n Two recent examples illustrate the power of threatened tort liability to\\n improve safety and health conditions. After learning that asphalt fumes\\n posed a potential cancer threat to workers, OSHA was under pressure to\\n regulate it as a carcinogen.281 Industry objected to the characterization and\\n efforts to regulate stalled. OSHA later began working with equipment\\n manufacturers to redesign paving equipment so it captures asphalt fumes,\\n limiting emissions.282 The technology is eighty percent effective. 283 This\\n voluntary agreement provides protection to workers by relying on manu-\\n facturers - the most likely focus of tort suits - to improve the safety of\\n their products.\\n A similar example of rulemaking initiated at the behest of product manu-\\n facturers is the standard-regulating training of power industrial truck op-\\n erators.24 Manufacturers of such equipment had sought immunity from\\n tort liability together with an OSHA standard specifying mandatory train-\\n 279.

Manufacturers presumably believe the rule\\n will shield them from liability for failure to warn of safety defects in their\\n equipment.\\n In other instances, potential liability to customers or patients can induce\\n firms to take action that also protects workers. For example, hospitals gen-\\n erally complied with Center for Disease Control recommendations for in-\\n fection control procedures before OSHA\\'s bloodborne pathogen standard\\n was published.286 The hospitals faced the potential of malpractice liability\\n and loss of accreditation for failure to do so.\\n These examples suggest that potential liability concerns other than\\n regulatory fines can prompt action to protect workers. OSHA can harness\\n these incentives best by identifying the parties with economic incentives to\\n take protective action without a regulatory spur. These may be the parties\\n most at risk of tort judgements. Once those parties are identified, OSHA\\n can tailor its policies to maximize the leverage it gets from other compen-\\n sation costs a firm may face.\\n 2. Technological Innovation\\n OSHA also can spur technological innovation in situations where a third\\n party may not have potential tort liability. For example, the agency could\\n identify and encourage use of alternatives to toxic substances in consulta-\\n tion with chemical or substance manufacturers. If sellers are able to sell\\n the new product as a replacement for the older, more dangerous chemical\\n or substance, workplaces will be safer. If the new product is the same price\\n as the old one, employers should adopt it to reduce its abatement costs. If\\n the new product is sold for a higher price, an employer may still buy it as\\n long as the additional cost is offset by a reduction in its regulatory, market,\\n or social costs.\\n OSHA\\'s failure to analyze innovative compliance technologies has been\\n criticized. According to the former Office of Technology Assessment\\n (OTA), OSHA \"devotes relatively little attention to examining the potential\\n of advanced technologies or the prospect of regulation-induced innovation\\n to provide technologically and economically superior options for hazard\\n control.287 OTA concluded that \"a good case can be made that a lack of\\n continuing insights on the potential of leading-edge technology hinders the\\n 285.

They have done so with little analysis of whether voluntary\\n compliance is likely to induce greater protection of the environment, work-\\n ers, or consumers. Our analysis suggests agency efforts would benefit from\\n greater precision in choosing between traditional regulation and reliance on\\n voluntary compliance. Voluntary compliance has the potential to induce\\n greater protection of the environment, workers, or consumers, but only in\\n narrowly circumscribed circumstances. Even when voluntary compliance\\n is effective, it is likely that it provides less protection than does regulation.\\n And, incentives for voluntary compliance are weakest in inducing protec-\\n tion of workers, so they should be relied on with greater caution in that\\n sphere.\\n \\n 288.

RAKOFF\\n TAKEHISA NAKAGAWA\\n Comparisons among the various forms of administrative law, and dia-\\n logues between the students and practitioners of each, are assuming new\\n importance daily. As national economies knit ever more closely together,\\n the differences among national legal regimes require increased attention.\\n This has long been obvious with respect to commercial law per se. In re-\\n cent years, it has become clear regarding laws that regulate economic life\\n and thus, even if intended solely for domestic effect, set the ground rules\\n for judging the fairness of international competition. Because adequate\\n comparison of legal regimes cannot rest solely on their stated substantive\\n norms, the next logical step is to focus on the various processes by which\\n regulatory norms are specified and applied. These processes are in large\\n part the domain of administrative law.\\n To find a linguafranca in which to make these comparative assessments\\n is no easy task. To view administrative law in solely its functional aspect is\\n surely inadequate. The law as a whole is too dependent on cultural atti-\\n tudes, and the field of administrative law specifically is too dependent on\\n particular configurations of political institutions, to allow for any assump-\\n tion of a neutral transnational metric. The proper scope and form of public\\n participation in the making of regulatory rules, for example, is only in part\\n a question of how such participation can lead to greater knowledge and,\\n hopefully, more effective rules. It is also a matter of how participation\\n links with legitimacy as viewed by the society, and how else each particular\\n political system provides for public participation.\\n We offer the following pair of Articles, not as an answer to this quest for\\n a common language, but as an initial exploration of the difficulties in-\\n volved. Perhaps a word as to the Articles\\' genesis will help clarify their\\n scope.\\n Professor Rakoff\\'s contribution, The Choice Between Formal and In-\\n formal Modes of Administrative Regulation, began as a talk given to the\\n law faculty of Kobe University, in Kobe, Japan, in the Spring of 1998. It\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n was an attempt to convey to a non-American audience the American expe-\\n rience regarding formality and informality in administrative law, and to re-\\n state the problem in a way that might transcend the insularity of that expe-\\n rience. His treatment depends in part on an analysis of the distinction\\n between formality and informality as comprising two sets of differences: a\\n continuum in which trial-type procedures represents the paradigm of pro-\\n cedural formality; and a continuum in which clear rules of law, whose ap-\\n plication can be accurately predicted ahead of time, stands as the archetype\\n of substantive formality.\\n Professor Nakagawa\\'s contribution, Administrative Informality in Ja-\\n pan: Governmental Activities Outside Statutory Authorization, grew out of\\n his response at the session in Kobe to Professor Rakoff\\'s talk, but has been\\n considerably revised for an American audience.\\' He argues that, to discuss\\n the issue of informality transnationally, it is necessary to add a third con-\\n tinuum that embraces matters of great concern to scholars of Japanese law.\\n This third continuum stretches from agency action in pursuit of goals\\n clearly authorized by statute (at its formal pole), to agency policy choices\\n aimed at goals clearly beyond legislatively authorized programs (at the\\n highly informal end). While American scholars might not automatically\\n consider issues of this sort to be about \"formality,\" Professor Nakagawa\\n argues that they have strong structural resemblances to the dimensions\\n identified by Professor Rakoff. Further, he suggests, there are phenomena\\n in American law that can be usefully analyzed in this way.\\n We have not tried to\\'combine these views into a single, syncretic analy-\\n sis of the problem. We hope that each of us has contributed something to-\\n wards building a framework for a transnational discussion of formality and\\n informality of administrative law, but undoubtedly there are yet additional\\n aspects that others will see. Certainly, we can speak for only two of the\\n many legal traditions that should be considered to formulate a comprehen-\\n sive approach. In short, we offer this colloquy as the start of a conversa-\\n tion, not as its final word.\\n 1.

From a broader standpoint, the\\n document is important because it frankly recognizes and treats a category\\n of administrative action called \"guidance.\"\\n \"Guidance\" as a named, identified legal category is something new in\\n American administrative law. The Administrative Procedure Acts of some\\n countries, such as Japan2 and Korea,3 address concepts with this title, but\\n * Byrne Professor of Administrative Law, Harvard Law School.

The index to the leading American administrative law trea-\\n tise, published in 1994, lists neither \"guidance\" nor \"administrative guid-\\n ance.\"4 Nor does the index to the administrative law casebook of which I\\n am co-editor, published in 1995.5 Indeed, the FDA had to devote the first\\n part of its statement simply to defining what it was talking about.\\n This explicit recognition of \"guidance\" is just one facet of the growing\\n tendency of American administrative agencies to return to what we, in the\\n United States, think of as informal administrative procedures. This Article\\n tries to outline the framework within which this development is occurring,\\n and to identify its dynamics as seen in America. It then suggests some\\n ways of evaluating formality and informality in administrative law that\\n might allow for comparison among legal systems. Throughout, the discus-\\n sion is restricted to administrative law as it relates to the role of modem\\n government as regulator of the economy.\\n I. THE AMERICAN LEGAL FRAMEWORK\\n Ought administrators - the Secretary of the Department of Labor, the\\n Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, or the Commis-\\n sioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission, for example - \"man-\\n age\" the economy? Americans have two answers to that question. On one\\n hand, many agencies administer statutes whose sole purpose is to change\\n the outcomes that would otherwise be produced by a laissez-faire economy.\\n If making the economy work so as to be consistent with the public welfare\\n constitutes \"management,\" then that is the precise business of administra-\\n tive agencies. On the other hand, administrators are government function-\\n aries, not businessmen. They are supposed to set and enforce the rules of\\n the game, but not to cross the line that separates the public from the private\\n as if they were playing the game themselves. If deciding the particular\\n goals individual businesses should pursue and how they should pursue\\n them constitutes \"management,\" then that is not, in the American view, the\\n concern of administrative agencies. In short, Americans are uneasy about\\n governmental management of the economy; they favor administrative ex-\\n pertise and the furtherance of the public interest, but also want agencies to\\n act in a law-like fashion.\\n These two points of view could both be satisfied if it were possible to\\n stipulate ahead of time, by broadly applicable rules of known application,\\n the norms necessary to make private behavior consistent with the public\\n 4.

STRAUSS ET AL., GELLHORN AND BYSE\\'s ADMINISTRATIVE LAW:\\n CASES AND COMMENTS 1437 (9th ed. 1995).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n MODES OF ADMINISTRA TIVE REG ULA TION\\n \\n interest. Under those conditions, administrators could fulfill their mandates\\n by making general rules, doing clearly public acts. The experience of the\\n twentieth century, however, at least as the experience is understood by\\n most law professors in the United States, is that this supposed program is,\\n in fact, impossible to carry out in a modem society. The variety of situa-\\n tions to which any important rule must be applied is so vast that the process\\n of application will inherently go beyond formal characterization, and in-\\n stead will require judgments of policy. Moreover, the expertise required to\\n choose the right path will often develop out of interaction between the ad-\\n ministrative agency and the regulated party, and thus, in a rather strict\\n sense, be unknowable ahead of time. Finally, the decisions to many mod-\\n em problems require the reconciliation of multiple points of view, so that in\\n many instances, the agency must be engaged more in balancing interests\\n than in applying rules. In short, effective use of administrative power in\\n modern circumstances necessitates substantial administrative discretion.\\n Does this mean that the program of the application of expertise and\\n adoption of a public-interest viewpoint, mediated by the rule of law, is im-\\n possible? The answer is yes, if we equate the \"rule of law\" with the exis-\\n tence of generally-applicable and decisive rules known ahead of time.\\n American administrative law, however, tries to escape this impossibility by\\n denying this equation. American administrative law defines the \"rule of\\n law\" more broadly than the \"rule of law\" that is understood by many Euro-\\n pean scholars.6\\n There is a general normative requirement in the United States that, to be\\n legitimate, an official\\'s power must be limited by law; this is true from the\\n President on down. These limits, however, can be set in many different\\n ways. For an administrative agency, the first limit is that its authority must\\n be granted and defined in a statutory delegation. Because we maintain a\\n system of separation of powers in which the executive branch and the leg-\\n islative branch are separately elected, and often controlled by separate po-\\n litical parties, this is a requirement of substance. It is often not easy for an\\n agency to convince Congress to enlarge its statutory authority. Addition-\\n ally, there is the common opportunity for judicial review of agency action.\\n On a more mundane level, agencies are required to act consistently with\\n their own precedents or explain the deviation, and to comply with their own\\n published rules until they change them. Finally, the lawfulness of the sys-\\n tem is enhanced by a general requirement of procedural regularity, which\\n reaches into the internal processes of the agency itself.\\n 6. See, e.g., FRIEDRicH A. HAYEK, THE CONSTITUTION OF LIBERTY 153-54 (1960)\\n (contending that rule of law consists in abstract rules that control judges\\' decisions).\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n In this mix, substantive rules of law are important. Agency lawyers try\\n very hard to give agency action a rule-like foundation. The rules, however,\\n are rarely fully dispositive. Rather, it is the presence of some fair quantum\\n of all these various techniques, considered together, that counts as the suf-\\n ficient \"legal\" basis for legitimate administrative action.\\n Within this framework, the traditional assumption has been that disputed\\n matters of real substance will be settled by procedures of real dignity. Of\\n course, it has always been true that administrators in the United States have\\n achieved their purposes in large part through informal means - by giving\\n speeches, threatening enforcement, or giving advice as to their view of the\\n law. In the background, however, has been the notion that when there is\\n substantial disagreement as to what the law allows, or what policy should\\n be followed, the issue will graduate to a more formal process of rulemaking\\n or adjudication.\\n The American Administrative Procedure Act (APA)7 was drafted from\\n this point of view. At the time the APA was written, it was stated that over\\n ninety percent of administrative action took place informally,8 but still the\\n Act was devoted to stipulating the procedures to be used for making le-\\n gally-binding regulations or carrying out formal adjudications. Several as-\\n sumptions were being made. Substantively, it was enough to say that in-\\n formal agency activities were not making new law. The practical impact of\\n such activities could be ignored since the issues resolved informally were\\n generally not contested or were fairly unimportant. Procedurally, the cen-\\n tral inquiry focused on what procedures ought to apply to rulemakings or\\n formal adjudications. Agencies were left to their own devices as to how\\n they otherwise announced their views. Finally, another matter often left to\\n the agency\\'s determination was whether to make policy through rulemak-\\n ing or adjudication. Because procedures had been stipulated for rulemak-\\n ing as well as for adjudication, each process had real procedural require-\\n ments for participation and for justification of the result; each was also\\n capable of generating a body of law over time.\\n II. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SYSTEM OF THE APA\\n The APA, although passed in 1946, just after the end of World War II,\\n remains the basic document of American administrative law with very little\\n amendment. The way in which its categories have intersected with admin-\\n istrative reality has, however, varied quite a bit.\\n \\n 7. 5 U.S.C. §§ 551-557 (1994 & Supp. IV 1998).\\n 8. See Hearings Before the Subcomm. of Comm. on the Judiciary on S 674, S. 675,\\n and S. 918, 79th Cong. 804 (1941) (testimony of Dean Acheason).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n MODES OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION\\n \\n During the 1950s and 1960s, most major regulation took place through\\n formal adjudicatory proceedings. This emphasis on developing law by de-\\n ciding individual cases proved deficient in three respects. First, it was\\n costly. Second, even though American lawyers are skilled in handling\\n caselaw, the law that could be extracted from agency decisions often\\n proved to be vague or contradictory. Third, the newer goals of regulation\\n that developed in the 1960s, such as protection of the environment, de-\\n pended on establishing generally applicable standards with precise con-\\n tours. Such standards are difficult to establish in the context of a single\\n case.\\n The response was to shift the emphasis of the system from adjudicating\\n cases to promulgating rules. This was done partly by Congress when it\\n mandated rulemaking in various environmental, health, and safety statutes.\\n The Supreme Court also played an important role. Under the APA, there\\n are, in fact, two procedural forms provided for rulemaking: one using trial-\\n type procedures, the other less formal. In the 1960s, the assumption was\\n that many agencies had to use trial-type rulemaking if they made rules at\\n all. The reality was that agencies refrained from making rules they would\\n have to justify with trial-type proof. In 1973, the Supreme Court in United\\n States v. Florida East Coast Railway Co.9 held that the Interstate Com-\\n merce Commission\\'s assumption that the statutory definition of its rule-\\n making power required formal rulemaking, was incorrect.10 The less for-\\n mal version of rulemaking described in the APA would suffice here, and by\\n extension would suffice for most agencies.\\n The upshot of these developments was a surge of administrative rule-\\n making. By 1980, over 5,000 distinct sets of rules were being proposed by\\n administrative agencies each year. \"\\n With so much regulating being done by rulemaking rather than by adju-\\n dication, one might think that the system as a whole had become less for-\\n mal. Indeed, if one reads the plain text of the APA, it does seem that the\\n less formal rulemaking process, while certainly not left entirely to agency\\n discretion, is not too demanding. The agency is required to give notice of\\n the substance of any proposed rule in a government publication called the\\n Federal Register, and then give the public a chance to comment on the\\n proposal.\\'2 This can be limited to the opportunity to submit views in writ-\\n ing. After considering these views, the agency can publish the rule in its\\n original form or with amendments, along with a \"concise general state-\\n 9. 410 U.S. 224 (1973).\\n 10. See id. at 227-28.\\n 11. See STRAUSS ET AL., supra note 5, at 305.\\n 12. See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)-(c).\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n ment\" of its rationale.\\'3 The courts review the rule under a relatively re-\\n laxed test, which requires the rule to be authorized by statute and not be ar-\\n bitrary or capricious.\\'4 In short, there is some public notification and pub-\\n lic interchange, but in the end, the standards of proof and justification are\\n not very stringent, and few procedural weapons exist for outsiders to wield\\n against the agency. The relaxed nature of the process is revealed by the\\n name by which this procedure is often identified: it is commonly called\\n \"notice-and-comment\" rulemaking.\\n Prior to the 1970s, these notice-and-comment provisions were read in\\n this straightforward fashion. The American legal culture, however, could\\n not tolerate such lack of formality once rulemaking of this sort became the\\n paradigmatic case of agency action. In light of the large substantive dis-\\n cretion many agencies had been given, doing so would seem to authorize\\n highhanded agency behavior. As a result, partly through legislative and\\n executive action, but primarily led by judges, these provisions were given\\n increasingly burdensome interpretations.\\n For example, agencies were required to provide the public from the start,\\n not only the substance of the proposed rule, but also the data on which the\\n agency relied to justify the rule.\\'5 Otherwise, it was said, the right to com-\\n ment on the rule would be of little value. Agencies were also required to\\n explain why they rejected at least the most forceful comments made by\\n regulated parties or the public; otherwise, they had not adequately ex-\\n plained the basis for the rule.\\'6 And on review, judges increasingly asked\\n the agency to justify the specific regulatory choice it had made, rather than\\n merely showing that the agency had not been, in the ordinary sense of the\\n term, arbitrary.\\'7 The flow of administrative decision-making had been di-\\n rected to notice-and-comment rulemaking because it was streamlined, but\\n the very importance of the flow caused further developments that, to a sub-\\n stantial degree, undermined the original purpose.\\n These developments were exacerbated by the new political culture that\\n developed after the inauguration of Ronald Reagan as President in 1981.\\n The organized bureaucracy of the government - the administrative agen-\\n cies - were seen by many in the Reagan Administration as the representa-\\n tives of entrenched interests that opposed the Chief Executive\\'s program of\\n deregulation. Further procedural requirements were imposed in order to\\n 13. Id. § 553(c).\\n 14.

That\\n these requirements made rulemaking yet more cumbersome did not dis-\\n suade an administration interested in less, not more, regulation. This\\n change of tone has by now influenced Congress as well. In 1996, Congress\\n provided for yet more reports, and yet more delay, in order to enable it to\\n review important administrative rules before they go into effect.\\'8\\n In short, notice-and-comment rulemaking - already more formal than\\n the rulemaking process in some other countries - has now become (even\\n though still known as \"informal\" rulemaking) an even more formal, more\\n burdensome, and more expensive process. Records in notice-and-comment\\n rulemaking proceedings are massive. Statements of justification that used\\n to be a few paragraphs or pages now run to tens of pages, each three col-\\n umns wide. Promulgating a major rule often takes years and represents a\\n substantial commitment of an agency\\'s resources. Law professors in the\\n United States now speak of the \"ossification\" of the rulemaking process.\\'9\\n To what degree this development thwarts, the democratic will, and to\\n what degree it accurately reflects it, is a debatable proposition. Much, al-\\n though not all, of the difficulty would disappear if agency budgets were in-\\n creased to match their increased burdens; that is not happening, and it could\\n be argued that at least an implicit democratic choice is being made. How-\\n ever, the size of agency budgets also reflects battles - regarding taxes, re-\\n tirement benefits and military needs, among others - that do not have\\n much to do with the desirable level of regulation. In any case, the current\\n situation certainly thwarts, or at least hinders, any effort of an active ad-\\n ministrator to get something done.\\n III. THE RETURN TO THE LESS FORMAL\\n Since the 1960s, then, administrative law in the United States has ex-\\n hausted the possibilities for developing an easily workable system of regu-\\n lation within the procedural forms articulated in the APA. Agencies inter-\\n ested in pursuing their programs, rather than just slowing down, must\\n search for ways to escape from these models of rulemaking and adjudica-\\n tion. We are in the midst of another round of discovering the virtues of in-\\n formality. There is renewed interest in resolving particular disputes short\\n of formal adjudication.° Of greater general import, there is a trend toward\\n 18. See 5 U.S.C. § 801 (Supp. IV 1998) (requiring submission of report to each House\\n of Congress and Comptroller General).\\n 19. See, e.g., Ronald M. Levin, More on Direct Final Rulemaking: Streamlining, Not\\n Corner-Cutting, 51 ADMIN. L. REV. 757, 767 (1999) (defining \"ossification debate\" as con-\\n troversy over whether accretion of burdensome administrative law requirements causes sti-\\n fling of agency rulemaking).\\n 20. See Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-552, 104 Stat.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n setting regulatory policy in less formal ways. Techniques that previously\\n were used as preliminaries to rulemaking or adjudication under the APA\\n are now being used on the assumption that they will constitute the final\\n disposition. Three such methods exemplify the trend: negotiated rulemak-\\n ing, the use of interpretative rules, and organized \"guidance.\"\\n The first negotiated rulemaking, or \"Reg-Neg,\" occurred in 1983, in a\\n proceeding organized by the Federal Aviation Administration to revise the\\n rules governing how long and how continuously airline pilots can fly. By\\n 1990, what had begun as an agency experiment was formally authorized by\\n Congress.2\\' By now, several agencies have experimented with Reg-Neg,\\n most notably the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and while the\\n total number of proceedings is still small, the idea has attracted consider-\\n able attention.\\n In negotiated rulemaking, an agency formulates its proposed rule by\\n means of discussions among a group of representatives of the interests to\\n be affected, perhaps twenty or twenty-five people in all. In an EPA pro-\\n ceeding regarding emission standards for home-heating wood stoves, for\\n example, two stove manufacturers, a trade association, two emissions con-\\n trols manufacturers, a consumers organization, an environmental organiza-\\n tion, several state governments, and the agency itself were all parties repre-\\n sented.  The participants negotiate the regulation operating under the\\n principle of consensus rather than majority rule. If consensus is reached,\\n notice of the proposed rule is then given to the public at large of the op-\\n portunity to comment on the rule before it becomes binding. The assump-\\n tion, however, is that the negotiated rule will become the final rule and,\\n moreover, that it will not be challenged in court because it has already been\\n vetted by the interests involved. Reg-Neg, then, tries to break the logjam\\n of regulation by moving the central arena from the public forum to the ne-\\n gotiating table.\\n A second approach to avoiding \"ossification\" is by increased use of \"in-\\n terpretative rules\" and \"policy statements.\" These include a broad range of\\n expressions of an agency\\'s position regarding either what existing law\\n means or how the agency proposes to use its discretion, which are not set\\n forth as ordinary regulations. For example, meat inspectors in the United\\n States have the power to close down meat-packing plants summarily if they\\n 2736, 3931 (codified at 5 U.S.C. § 571 (1994 & Supp. IV 1998)). The Administrative Dis-\\n pute Resolution Act gave agencies added authority to use alternative dispute resolution pro-\\n cesses, but indicated that such processes should not be used when they would fail to gener-\\n ate needed authoritative precedents. 5 U.S.C. § 572(b)(1) (1994).\\n 21. See Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-648, 104 Stat. 4970,\\n 6697 (codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 561-570 (1994 & Supp. IV 1998)). The authority, originally\\n granted for a six-year trial period, was made permanent in 1996. See 5 U.S.C. § 571 (Supp.\\n 111996).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n MODES OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION\\n \\n find violations of health regulations. Many of the standards they enforce\\n are based on field bulletins that have never gone through public rulemaking\\n procedures. To the same effect, the enacted regulations under the Federal\\n Mine Safety and Health Act of 197722 speak generally of equipment having\\n to be soundly engineered and safe. The precise requirements enforced by\\n the Mine Safety and Health Administration as to any particular machine are\\n found only in policy statements that are sent out to the regulated industry\\n but never formally adopted.23\\n Under the APA, if an agency does not treat such standards as having\\n binding legal effect - does not deal with them as if they were conclusive\\n of the underlying legal rights - then it does not have to adopt them\\n through the notice-and-comment process. True, pursuant to the Freedom of\\n Information Act, the standards usually need to be published or otherwise\\n made available to the public.24 Thus, there is some public process, if by\\n \"public\" we mean the opposite of \"secret.\" This is not inconsequential.25\\n But the demands on the agency for interchange with the public, or for for-\\n mal justification, are greatly reduced.\\n Of course, statements that are not legally conclusive can have substantial\\n practical impact when issued by those in power. If an agency, without\\n promulgating a nominally-legally-binding regulation, generates a set of\\n detailed guidelines for its inspectors to enforce, it in effect still establishes\\n the law for all those unwilling to pay the expense, or suffer the ill-will of\\n challenging the agency in court. Similarly, when an agency says it will no\\n longer prosecute violations of law below a certain threshold, it may not be\\n saying that those actions are lawful. From a practical point of view, how-\\n ever, it usually comes to the same result. (Indeed, on some jurisprudential\\n views, it is the very same thing as defining what behavior is legal.)\\n While it is difficult to document statistically, agencies seem to be re-\\n sorting increasingly to this mechanism for accomplishing their tasks with-\\n out paying the procedural price of rulemaking or adjudication. Certainly,\\n the number of lawsuits objecting to the practice, in one guise or another,\\n has greatly increased in the last decade-and-a-half.\\n This brings us to our third development, the matter with which this Arti-\\n cle began: the FDA\\'s adoption of \"Good Guidance Practices.\" What the\\n FDA did was to take the APA\\'s lenient attitude toward interpretative rules\\n 22.

By\\n contrast, since the start of this decade there has been a striking increase in\\n the number of FDA-issued documents intended to give guidance to the\\n regulated industry but not adopted through public procedures. The rate per\\n year for the 1990s is about four hundred percent greater than the rate for\\n the 1980s.7 This decrease in the number of enacted rules, and this increase\\n in the number of guidance documents led to cries that the required proce-\\n dures were being subverted. Under pressure from industry, and to some\\n extent from the courts as well, the FDA responded with a substantial, pub-\\n lic proceeding -  much like a rulemaking proceeding -  in order to de-\\n velop the very procedures by which this new process would be carried out.\\n The scope of the matter can be seen from the definition of the term\\n \"guidance documents\" that the agency ultimately adopted. While speeches\\n or warning letters were not included, the term does cover documents di-\\n rected either to the agency\\'s own staff or to the public that relate to: the\\n evaluation or approval of proposed new drugs; the production and testing\\n of regulated products; the agency\\'s inspection and enforcement procedures;\\n or documents that broadly describe \"the agency\\'s policy and regulatory ap-\\n proach to an issue.\"28 At the same time, the FDA takes pains to state that\\n guidance documents \"are not legally binding on the public or the agency.\\n Rather, they explain how the agency believes the statutes and regulations\\n apply to certain regulated activities.\\'29 Indeed, the FDA remains open to\\n discussing \"[a]lternative methods that comply with the [applicable] statute\\n or regulations .  ,.0 In short, guidance documents are meant to be state-\\n ments of no legal consequence but immense practical consequence about\\n virtually everything the agency regulates.\\n As far reaching as this is, it still would be a mistake to assume that\\n \"guidance\" in FDA parlance matches in all aspects \"administrative guid-\\n ance\" as it is known in Japan. Insofar as emphasis is placed on having a\\n practical effect on behavior but no binding legal effect, and thus, on relying\\n 26. See John C.

However, the\\n FDA\\'s program excludes from its scope \"communications directed to indi-\\n vidual persons or firms,\"32 which are at the core of the Japanese approach,\\n and thus in some sense still visualizes \"guidance\" as rule-bound behavior.\\n Finally, in some examples of Japanese administrative guidance, the agency\\n may deliberately go beyond its statutory authority, which the FDA, like all\\n American agencies, would certainly claim not to do.33\\n The \"Good Guidance Practices\" statement divides guidance documents\\n into two groups. The documents in the first, more important, group \"set\\n forth first interpretations of statutory or regulatory requirements, changes in\\n interpretation or policy that are of more than a minor nature, unusually\\n complex scientific issues, or highly controversial issues.34 The stipulated\\n procedures for this group provide that the agency will publish a notice of\\n the draft guidance in the Federal Register, accept written comments and\\n perhaps hold public meetings regarding the draft, review the comments,\\n and \"make changes to a guidance document in response to comments as\\n appropriate.\\'\\'35 It would not be far-fetched to rephrase these matters by\\n saying that the FDA now proposes to issue its important regulations mostly\\n in accordance with the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedure set forth\\n in the APA, as it was understood before 1970.\\n The only difference is that, at least in the agency\\'s view, the entire mat-\\n ter will be beyond the purview of the courts. The promulgated policies will\\n not legally bind the agency or regulated parties, and the stipulated proce-\\n dures are not intended to confer procedural rights. But is that such a differ-\\n ence? The FDA appears to thinks it is not, as it proposes to set forth new\\n interpretations of statutory requirements and other regulatory changes \"of\\n more than a minor nature\" in this fashion.36 It appears that the industry\\n thinks it is not a great difference either, since it participated extensively in\\n the proceeding to establish these \"good guidance practices.\" In this highly\\n regulated industry, in which all the players - including the agency, the\\n 31.

EVALUATION OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS\\n American administrative agencies are, once again, developing, in the\\n shadow of a highly formal system of administrative law, less formal ways\\n of getting their work done. The value of these developments is, of course,\\n open to debate.\\n Of regulatory negotiation, it can be said that by establishing a realm of\\n discussion and negotiation, agencies will be able to discover and implement\\n solutions that represent added value for all the affected parties. On the\\n negative side, there are real fears that, in the quest for consensus, agencies\\n will forget the very statutes that are their reason for being, and either under-\\n enforce their mandates or pursue different goals altogether.\\n Regarding the increased use by agencies of interpretative rules and pol-\\n icy statements, the positive side is that this process fills the need for law in\\n many regulatory environments in which the resources to use the complex\\n procedures for rulemaking do not exist. It is often better to have informal\\n guides than no guides at all. Against this, it is argued that the required pro-\\n cedures have the precise purpose of disciplining an agency\\'s quest for\\n power, and that agencies should not be allowed to escape that discipline.\\n Finally, the creation by the FDA of a whole organized system of rules\\n contained in guidance documents can be seen either as an example of\\n thoughtful and balanced institutional creativity, or as a brazen attempt to\\n subvert the APA as construed by the courts.\\n To adjudicate the truth of these various particular arguments would be to\\n stay within the confines of the American legal system. From the point of\\n view of developing an adequate theory, it would be desirable to restate this\\n experience at a level of generality that would allow us to debate its value\\n without regard to the peculiarities of a single system. This, however, is not\\n easy to do. What we see in the American experience is a cyclical phe-\\n nomenon in which less formal modes of regulation are invented; over time,\\n they become increasingly formalized; and then newer, less formal modes\\n are developed. But what seems to drive the redevelopment of formality in\\n these cycles are especially American ways of looking at the law. First,\\n there is the strongly-held belief in a separation of powers such as exists\\n among the constitutionally-established branches of government in the\\n United States. Rulemaking, which is to say delegated legislation, ought to\\n remain separate from adjudication, and both processes ought to be separate\\n from the day-to-day decisions of administrators, which is to say, execu-\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n MODES OF ADMINISTRATIVE REG ULA TION\\n \\n tives. Second, there is a strongly legalistic culture that is not merely the\\n domain of lawyers but rather is shared by a large part of the society, and\\n which legitimizes official action in terms of the existence of rules and of\\n the opportunity to be heard. No method exists by which the lessons of the\\n American experience can be stated wholly separate from these institutional\\n and cultural commitments.\\n What can be done, however, is to restate the lessons of the American ex-\\n perience (or those lessons as understood by this author), not as established\\n truths, but rather as hypothesis suitable for further testing in a cross-cultural\\n environment.\\n Accordingly, one might try to imagine the entire scale of legal formality,\\n not as it exists in any one system, but in its entire range. At the extremely\\n formal end of the continuum exists a highly specified substantive norm,\\n established through a very transparent and participatory process, published\\n well ahead of its application, and applied through full trial-type procedures.\\n At the highly informal end exists an official entitled to direct an indefinite\\n range of affairs as he sees fit, without giving any explanation or holding\\n any prior hearing.\\n With that continuum in mind, the first hypothesis is this:\\n In the process of regulating the economy through administrative action,\\n processes which are partially formal, and partially informal, are to be\\n preferred over either very formal processes or very informal processes.\\n In other words, the general run of economic regulation - which does not\\n greatly implicate civil liberties - will be best carried out by a process ly-\\n ing somewhere in the middle of the scale.\\n Formality has its uses. Substantive rules that are clear and publicly\\n known help generate equality before the law. They make it easier to iden-\\n tify instances of favoritism or corruption, and therefore help deter those\\n diseases. The ability of regulated parties to plan their affairs is enhanced,\\n and that the economists say, contributes to the rationality of the economic\\n system. Formal procedures, for their part, deter hasty action. They require\\n administrators to think through and defend every aspect of their programs,\\n and thereby help avoid costly regulatory errors. They also allow regulated\\n parties, and often the general public, to be heard in a setting where what\\n they say cannot be ignored. The risk of authoritarian behavior - or of the\\n appearance of authoritarian behavior - is thereby reduced.\\n Informality also has its uses. Open-ended, general grants of authority\\n are needed in a fast-changing world where not all evils can be foreseen. If\\n administrators must wait to enact through public processes new, precisely-\\n tailored rules, before they can act, much harm can be done, which can only\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n be undone later at much greater cost. Regulated parties who wish to disre-\\n gard the public welfare will have an incentive to look for gaps in the rules\\n and exploit them during the delay required to put new laws on the books.\\n Informal procedures also permit regulators to act in a timely fashion.\\n Regulators can use their general experience without having to shoulder the\\n burden of defending what they know to the satisfaction of less knowledge-\\n able outsiders. Finally, it is valuable for administrative officials to have,\\n and to be seen to have, real power. Among the population as a whole, this\\n generates confidence in the ability of the state to protect the general wel-\\n fare. Among the regulated entities, it generates a willingness to cooperate\\n with, rather than contest, needed programs.\\n The respective truths of these parallel but conflicting sets of contentions\\n can best be known through experience. Imagining the continuum of possi-\\n bilities, we in the United States have not, as regards matters of importance,\\n had much experience with the highly informal side wherein administrative\\n officials can settle matters without any standard, explanation, or public\\n process. Our legal culture has prevented us from doing much experiment-\\n ing there. We have had, however, a lot of experience in the terrain between\\n the mid-point and the fully formal pole. Indeed, as have seen, we have\\n vacillated between formal and half-formal processes. Each has its parti-\\n sans. My view is that the half-formal processes - such as our organized,\\n public rule-making was before we ritualized it - have served us much\\n better. It is not that formality becomes counterproductive in its own terms.\\n A fully articulated and justified new rule enacted after a fully open pro-\\n ceeding, such as our courts now often require, is in fact a beautiful example\\n of the lawyer\\'s art. The costs of getting there, however, are too great, as\\n are the costs of leaving important matters unregulated, not because agen-\\n cies lack authority, but because they lack resources. Partly formal proce-\\n dures can still provide opportunities for public participation and assurances\\n that agency action stays within the ambit of agency authority. In short, the\\n current desire of administrative agencies to reinvent these partially formal,\\n partially informal procedures represents a proper concern for getting their\\n jobs done, rather than an improper desire to acquire power for power\\'s\\n sake. While a judgment as to the success of the precise procedures the\\n FDA has chosen to use in establishing its organized system of half-formal,\\n half-informal \"guidance\" must await the test of time, it seems to me ex-\\n periments of this sort are well worth pursuing.\\n Of course, this judgment is based solely on the American experience\\n with administrative law. In its more general form, it stands merely as a hy-\\n pothesis.\\n To understand the second hypothesis, it is important to remember that\\n there are both substantive and procedural dimensions to formality, as well\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n MODES OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION\\n \\n as to informality. At the formal end of the continuum exist clear rules of\\n law, known ahead of time, that specify the substance of what administrators\\n should do. We also have trial-type procedures. At the informal end exist\\n statutes that grant administrators a large amount of substantive discretion\\n with no required procedures.\\n With that relationship in mind, the second hypothesis is:\\n In the design of administrative processes for regulating the economy, pro-\\n cedural aspects of legal formality and substantive aspects of legal formality\\n are to a large extent interchangeable.\\n In other words, fewer procedures are needed when an agency is operating\\n under a clearly defined, easily applied rule of law than when it is carrying\\n out a fuzzy rule or operating under a simple grant of discretionary author-\\n ity.\\n The combination of the substantive formality of clear rules and the pro-\\n cedural formality of trial-type proceedings certainly has its place in the law,\\n even in administrative law; for example, when fundamental civil rights are\\n at issue. In the ordinary course of economic regulation, however, there ap-\\n pears to be a trade-off. When the rule is clear, the administrative agency\\n can usually be trusted to determine where the rule appropriately applies,\\n after some interchange, to be sure, but without undergoing a formal hear-\\n ing. When the rule is open-ended, and the best policy obscure, the agency\\n needs to be confronted forcefully with facts about the world and with ar-\\n guments as to how its discretion should be exercised. These facts and ar-\\n guments - especially if they come from sources other than the regulated\\n parties the agency usually talks to - will often contradict the agency\\'s\\n own preconceptions. For this very reason, some formality that will force\\n the agency to pay attention is often desirable.\\n The interplay of substantive and procedural formality also responds to\\n the more general need to legitimize and control administrative agencies.\\n The source of much of the pressure for formalized proceedings, at least in\\n American administrative law, is an underlying unease with the degree of\\n substantive discretion granted to agencies in their statutory authority. If on\\n judicial review, for example, judges could measure what the agencies had\\n done against a clear and sharp definition of what they were entitled to do,\\n there would be much less concern over whether the agencies had thought\\n through their alternative courses of action. It is not that the two tests are\\n exact functional equivalents; one constitutes a determination of authority\\n while the other is a measure of instrumental rationality. However, in the\\n larger sense of assuring that agencies are being kept under control, they\\n would be interchangeable.\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n Here again, working solely from American law, the general principle\\n cannot be sensibly disentangled from the single institutional context. Much\\n of the argument just suggested is contingent on an acceptance of the flexi-\\n ble view of the \"rule of law\" that is typical of American administrative law,\\n but perhaps not prevalent elsewhere. Indeed, we should note that even\\n American law does not carry out the full implications of this view. For ex-\\n ample, cases under the due process clause often require - wrongly, in my\\n view - that there be a legitimate claim to a well-defined substantive right\\n in order to \"trigger\" the constitutionally-imposed procedural protection.37\\n Once again, then, this proposition regarding substitutability is presented\\n merely as a hypothesis for discussion.\\n There is one last point to make. If both hypotheses are true - if par-\\n tially formal, partially informal administrative processes are the preferable\\n type of processes, and if, for many purposes substantive and procedural\\n formality are interchangeable - then the interesting conclusion can be\\n drawn that, while some systems of administrative law will be better than\\n some other systems, there is no way to specify the contents of a uniquely\\n best system. Several systems - in principal, an unknown number - will\\n each equally satisfy the identified criteria.\\n This is not a trivial point. It suggests that even if it is true that the eco-\\n nomic systems of modem nations are increasingly going to look alike, there\\n is no particular functional reason why their systems of administrative law\\n should converge in any particular respect. That conclusion, in turn, has\\n practical consequences. With the continuing demise of trade barriers, we\\n are all becoming, more and more, observers and critics of each other\\'s\\n systems of regulation in the name of competitive fairness. This has an im-\\n portant purpose, as no one wants to live in a world in which governments\\n cannot protect their citizens from the excesses of an unregulated world\\n market. However, these hypotheses, if true, suggest that in judging each\\n other\\'s systems, it is important to remember that there is more than one\\n road to heaven.\\n \\n 37. See Todd D.

As early as the 1940s, the United\\n States was associated with the well-known statement that \"informal proce-\\n dures ... are truly the lifeblood of the administrative process.\"\\' Japanese\\n administrative law has also extended intensive treatment to administrative\\n informality, apparent in the creation of the concept of \"administrative guid-\\n ance.\" Despite shared interests, noteworthy differences can be identified in\\n the way \"informality\" is understood and discussed in Japan and the United\\n States.\\n First, the terminology of informality is apparently not identical. To be\\n sure, there are some categories of administrative activities that are com-\\n monly thought of as informal. Internal, or non-legislative standards, such\\n as interpretive rules and policy statements, do constitute one of such com-\\n mon categories of informality. Administrative guidance as discussed in Ja-\\n pan and its American counterparts is another example of administrative in-\\n formality in both nations. However, summary actions and application\\n denials without hearings, for example, are considered informal in American\\n administrative law,2 while they are not considered informal in Japan. Sev-\\n eral Japanese statutes explicitly provide for administrative guidance in the\\n form of recommendations, advice, or request by the agency; and such ac-\\n tions are oftentimes characterized as formal administrative guidance. It\\n seems to the author that negotiated decisionmaking in the administrative\\n process is categorically thought of as informal phenomena in the United\\n States, while they are not necessarily so in Japan.\\n Second, even the overlapping phenomena commonly thought of as in-\\n formal are often subject to different frameworks of legal analysis. As this\\n Article will demonstrate, some of the legal analyses given to administrative\\n guidance in Japan do not seem to comport with the discussion of its Ameri-\\n can counterparts. Undoubtedly, the similarities and differences between\\n the two nations\\' treatment and discussion of administrative informality can\\n be confusing. This Article compares these various similarities and differ-\\n ences in an effort to clarify the differences in informal administrative pro-\\n cedure.\\n The Article first presents in Part I an outline that demonstrates the dif-\\n ferences in the terminology of informality in the United States and Japan.\\n 1.

Doc. No. 77-8, at 35-42.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n Two kinds of understanding of the dichotomy of formality and informality\\n are shown there, based on the author\\'s impression of how lawyers in both\\n nations use the word \"formality.\" The outline is intended to be a tentative\\n one, to help the discussion in this Article, and may be subject to further re-\\n finement in the future.\\n Parts II and III are devoted to explication of legal analyses given to ad-\\n ministrative guidance, which constitute the heart of Japan\\'s discussion of\\n administrative informality. In Part II, an overview of the conventional un-\\n derstanding of administrative guidance is given, followed by the author\\'s\\n own appraisal of the concept. The author demonstrates that various legal\\n analyses of administrative guidance that have thus far appeared in judicial\\n opinions and literature should be divided into two groups, in each of which\\n at least three different types (six types in sum) of administrative guidance\\n can be discerned. As far as known to the author, Japanese administrative\\n guidance discussed in English-language materials have often been limited\\n to a small part of the whole; and the purpose of Part II is to show the whole\\n picture of legal discussion on administrative guidance in Japan.\\n Part III sets forth two representative Japanese Supreme Court decisions\\n on administrative guidance. The two decisions are chosen both because\\n they have formed the core doctrines of administrative guidance, and be-\\n cause they perhaps represent the most Japanese feature among the above-\\n mentioned six types of administrative guidance. As such, they must be\\n looked at from comparative perspectives.\\n Part IV then presents another tentative map for administrative informal-\\n ity in comparison between the two nations. Three categories of adminis-\\n trative activities are depicted here and are commonly thought as informal.\\n Part IV focuses on a discussion of the degree to which legal analyses given\\n to each category in one nation parallels to those in the other.\\n This Article concludes with a comment on Professor Rakoff\\'s argument\\n on the choice between formality and informality.\\n I. JAPANESE FORMALITY AND AMERICAN FORMALITY\\n The dichotomy of formality and informality seems to be conceptualized\\n differently in Japan and the United States, respectively. Presented here is a\\n tentative model of how lawyers of both nations understand the dichotomy\\n while discussing administrative law problems, setting aside daily - not\\n particularly legalistic - use of the terms.\\n It may be safely said that in Japan, certain phenomena are considered in-\\n formal, either in the sense that actions are not what the enabling statute\\n substantively authorizes the agency to do, or in the sense that the actions\\n are not what the relevant statute procedurally imposes the agency to follow,\\n i.e., phenomena that are not the modes, substantive or procedural, of action\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n provided for in the statutes.3 Formality refers to nothing more than under-\\n taking action that is legally, or statutorily, provided for, such as filing a\\n lawsuit instead of out-of-the-court settlement efforts, or an agency\\'s issuing\\n an improvement order instead of gently persuading alleged violators to\\n adopt voluntary improvement efforts. Thus, it follows that informality re-\\n fers to activities that are undertaken outside the scope of statutory programs\\n or outside statutorily prescribed processes; it takes the form of either a pur-\\n suit of a policy goal or an undertaking of procedure, neither of which are\\n explicitly or implicitly stated in relevant statutes. From this articulation,\\n though tentative, of Japanese formality and informality, it should easily be\\n understood why Japanese discussion on administrative informality includes\\n administrative guidance, internal agency standards, and so-called \"con-\\n tractual approaches\" to Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) facilities.4 These\\n phenomena are all characterized as informal because of their extra-legality\\n or extra-statutoriality. It should be advised that administrative guidance\\n and contractual approaches are no longer called informal in some limited\\n cases where they are explicitly provided for in statutes.\\n 3. This use of formality-informality is generally compatible with the word found in\\n English-language literature on Japanese law, though it sometimes seems that the authors\\n also imply American terminology of \"formality\" and \"informality.\" See JOHN HALEY,\\n AUTHORITY WrHouT POWER 161-63 (1991) (stating, for example, \"what distinguishes Ja-\\n pan is the persuasive resort to informal enforcement in contexts that seem to require formal\\n regulation in other industrial states\"); FRANK K. UPHAM, LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN\\n POsTwA JAPAN 22, 168, 173, 198-99, 222-26 (1987); Curtis J. Milhaput, Managing the\\n Market: The Ministry of Finance and Securities Regulation in Japan, 30 STAN. J. INT\\'L L.\\n 423, 445 (1994) (contrasting the United States Securities Exchange Commission\\'s emphasis\\n on the formal, prosecutorial aspect of its mission with the Japanese Ministry of Finance\\'s\\n emphasis on its promotional role and use of a highly informal regulatory stance); Michael\\n K. Young, Judicial Review of Administrative Guidance: Governmentally Encouraged Con-\\n sensual Dispute Resolution in Japan, 84 COLUM. L. REv. 923, 967-68 (1984) (indicating\\n lack of reverence for legal process).\\n 4. The contractual approach denotes efforts to reach an agreement between NIMBY\\n facilities and nearby agencies or local governments to the effect that the facilities shall abide\\n by certain conditions, which are not provided for in relevant statutes, regulations, or local\\n ordinances, for the purpose of preventing possible nuisances or harm. Local government\\n has often involved itself with this approach, either as a mediator to settle conflicts between\\n NIMBY facilities and nearby residents towards their making an agreement, or through the\\n local government itself being a party to such agreement. The court recognizes contractual\\n relations and legally-binding effects to be formed from such agreements when stipulations\\n are concrete enough. For a general discussion of contractual approaches, see, for example,\\n J. GRESSERETAL., ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IN JAPAN 248-49 (1981). See also Yoshikazu Shi-\\n baike, Guidelines and Agreements in Administrative Law, 19 L. JAPAN 63, 76-89 (Russell\\n Allen Yeomans trans. 1986).\\n 5. For examples of administrative guidance that are provided for in statutes, see Yori-\\n aki Narita, Administrative Guidance, 2 L. JAPAN 45, 55-56 (James L. Anderson trans. 1968).\\n See also Kazuo Yamanouchi, Administrative Guidance and the Rule of Law, 7 L. JAPAN 22,\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRA TIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n Informal actions have attracted attention from the Japanese legal com-\\n munity because of their practical effects on private individuals and firms.\\n Neither internal agency standards nor administrative guidance have legal\\n effects, but they usually exert practical influence on private entities. Also,\\n there have been shared concerns among academics concerning the legiti-\\n macy of governmental activities that are beyond what they are authorized\\n to do. Through practical effects of administrative guidance or internal\\n standards, or through possible legally binding effects of agreements formed\\n out of the contractual approaches, concerns for governance beyond law is\\n thought to be realistic. Thus, occasional disparity between what is legally\\n required and the realities of the administrative process has driven legal\\n commentators to inquire into administrative informality.\\n Informality as understood this way, then, logically has both a substantive\\n side and procedural side; substantive policy that is not authorized by stat-\\n ute, and the avoidance of certain statutory procedures provided for in stat-\\n utes. Out of these two phases of informality, the Japanese have focused\\n much more on the former: government activities conducted outside specific\\n programs authorized by the legislature. Although some attention is paid to\\n procedural aspects of Japanese informality, most of the discussion on Japa-\\n nese administrative informality has been focused on the substantive side.\\n The two Japanese Supreme Court decisions analyzed in this Article are ex-\\n amples of substantive informality, if it may be called so, in the sense that\\n administrative agencies are establishing extra-statutory policies. \"Sub-\\n stantive informality\" is an agency\\'s choice among policy preferences when\\n no legislative authorization for the choice exists. It should be obvious that\\n such extra-statutory policy goals may not violate any existing statutes. The\\n unresolved question is whether an agency\\'s formation and implementation\\n of extra-statutory policy goals can at all be legitimate; and if it can, what\\n 23-25 (1974); Russel Allen Yeomans, Administrative Guidance: A Peregrine View, 19 L.\\n JAPAN 125, 144-47 (1986). For an example of statutorily provided contractual approaches.\\n see Shibaike, supra note 4, at 85.\\n One well-known decision by the Tokyo High Court distinguishes between statutorily\\n provided administrative guidance under the name of \"recommendaiton\" and its preliminary.\\n de facto administrative guidance. This recommendation is provided for in the Sekiyu-Gyo-\\n HO [Petroleum industry law], Law No. 128 of 1962, to be conducted by the Ministry of In-\\n dustry and International Trade (MITI), and a de facto recommendation by the MITI to the\\n same effect, that may be conducted as a preliminary to the statutorily provided recommen-\\n dation. See Japan v. Association of Petroleum Indus., 983 HANJI 22 (High Ct. of Tokyo,\\n Sept. 26, 1980). Professor Meryll Dean quite properly describes the former, statutory rec-\\n ommendation as \"formal administrative guidance\" and the latter, de facto recommendation,\\n \"informal administrative guidance.\" See Meryll Dean, Administrative Guidance in Japa-\\n nese Law: A Threat to the Rule of Law, 1991 J. Bus. L. 398, 401. For another example of\\n the same usage of \"formal\" and \"informal\" administrative guidance, see Yamanouchi, su-\\n pra, at 23-25.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n other conditions are required for extra-statutory policymaking to be legiti-\\n mate in addition to not being violative of any existing statutes.\\n On the other hand, in the United States, it seems that informality has al-\\n most always been thought of as a lack of procedural formality - a lack of\\n the necessary elements to be adversarial. Formality, as is understood by\\n American administrative lawyers, is clearly articulated by Professor Todd\\n Rakoff.6 He describes formality to have both substantive and procedural\\n aspects: substantive rules set forth in advance, and adversarial procedural\\n protection. Out of the two phases of this American informality, emphasis\\n is put on the procedural phase: the word \"informality\" more often means\\n procedural formats that lack the procedural ingredients of formality. The\\n scope of procedural informality may range from simplified formal proce-\\n dures (shortened and abbreviated formal adjudication), or procedures that\\n lack the necessary rigor of being adversarial (such as the notice-and-\\n comment rulemaking, usually called informal rulemaking); to alternative\\n techniques inconsistent with the whole idea of procedural formality (such\\n as ADR techniques and the Reg-Neg., which is the negotiation process be-\\n fore the rulemaking process starts). Summary actions and application deni-\\n als without hearings are thereby considered as another example of informal\\n action.\\n When American lawyers argue in favor of informality, the bottom line is\\n usually that procedural formality should be alleviated to a reasonable de-\\n gree, either by reducing excessive procedural requirements or by allowing\\n alternative methodologies (negotiation). It should be noted that procedural\\n informality in the United States deals with governmental activities that are\\n supposedly within the scope of statutorily authorized programs. It seems to\\n be a fairly recent occurrence that concerns similar to Japanese substantive\\n informality appear in American informality discussions.\\n Substantive informality that encompasses policy choices made outside\\n the legislatively authorized programs is the center of concern in Japan. In\\n contrast, in the United States, commentators are usually interested in pro-\\n cedural informality, referring to procedural formats that lack important in-\\n gredients of adversarial procedures, which ingredients represent the proce-\\n dural side of the American version of formality. Doctrine and literature in\\n the two nations have been built upon the different conceptions of formality-\\n informality (see Figure 1). Thus, for example, what Professor Rakoff dis-\\n cusses in terms of a \"continuum\" from extreme formality down to extreme\\n informality7 could be confusing at first glance to some Japanese lawyers, as\\n they would never use the words of formality and informality to explain the\\n 6.

See id.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n same idea. Likewise, if a statute were to be enacted in Japan that author-\\n izes negotiation similar to the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of the United\\n States,8 most academics of Japan would not call the negotiated rulemaking\\n procedure an informal one, because such negotiation is a formally - i.e.,\\n statutorily - authorized procedure to undertake.\\n FIGURE 1: CONCEPTION OF INFORMALITY IN COMPARISON\\n (* INDICATES THE FOCUS OF ACADEMIC ATTENTION)\\n JAPANESE CONCEPTION OF           UNITED STATES CONCEPTION\\n INFORMALITY                      OF INFORMALITY\\n Substantive Side*                  Substantive Side\\n A Pursuit Of Extra-Statutory Policy  Lack Of Concrete Rules Set Forth In\\n Goals                            Advance\\n Procedural Side                   Procedural Side*\\n A Pursuit Of Statutory Policy Goals In  Lack Of Adversary Elements Of\\n Extra-Statutory Methods                  Procedure\\n The different conceptualizations of the formality-informality dichotomy\\n should be attributed to the two different understandings of the rule of law in\\n the two nations. In the Japanese administrative law community, the rule of\\n law, or the German-originated Rechtsstattsprinzip, basically entails the\\n substantive requirement that agencies act in accordance with what the con-\\n stitution and the Diet order through its statutes.9 On the other hand, proce-\\n dural implications of the rule of law, or the Rechtsstattsprinzip, have tradi-\\n tionally been dim. Although not a few academics argue for reconstructing\\n the rule of law concept embodied in the Japanese constitution to include\\n procedural protection, what they have in mind is far from trial-type proce-\\n dure, the ultimate American formality. Quasi-judicial procedure, compara-\\n ble to the United States Administrative Procedure Act (APA),10 rarely oc-\\n curs in Japan.\"\\n American formalism, in its procedural connotations, does not exist in the\\n Japanese legal tradition.

The Constitution of Japan re-\\n quires some kind of procedural protection of the administrative process, a\\n concept that was also a theoretical background of the APL.13 The main\\n thrust of the Japanese APL is to keep governmental agencies within statu-\\n tory frameworks - the Japanese concept of formality. The APL is applied\\n automatically once an agency action falls within the \"disposition\" category,\\n which is roughly comparable to \"orders,\" \"license,\" \"licensing,\" \"sanc-\\n tion,\" and \"relief\\' in the United States APA.14         Such automatically-\\n applicable procedures for dispositions are quite simple, and far from adver-\\n sary. The basic structure of procedural requirements for dispositions as\\n prescribed in the APL is a combination of three procedural ingredients: (1)\\n prior standard setting; (2) a simple opportunity to be heard, which is far\\n from a quasi-judicial procedure;15 and (3) a concise statement of reason.6\\n It may be comparable to the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedure of\\n the American APA as originally contemplated: it consists of a notice of\\n contemplated issuance of a disposition, and an opportunity for the ad-\\n dressee to tell its side of the story.17 Note that the APL does not provide\\n for a generally imposed procedure for rulemaking.\\'8\\n 12.

For adverse dispositions such as the suspension of a license, the APL only requires\\n the agency to give the addressee an opportunity to make a written presentation of its case to\\n the charging official. See Gy6sei-Tetsuzuki-H6 [Administrative procedures act], Law No.\\n 88 of 1993, arts. 13, 29-31. A more rigorous procedure is required when the agency issues\\n adverse dispositions of a more severe nature, such as license revocation. In such case, the\\n agency must provide an opportunity for an oral hearing before an officer who is different,\\n but not necessarily \"separate,\" from the charging official. The addressee has a right to in-\\n spect the agency\\'s files during the hearing. See id arts. 13, 15-28. The second procedural\\n format is not as rigorous as formal procedures in the United States. United States formal\\n procedure counterparts are rare in Japan and include the procedures of the Fair Trade Com-\\n mission. Actually, it is said that at an early stage of the drafting process of the APL, an un-\\n derstanding was clearly shared among drafters that quasi-judicial procedures should not be\\n incorporated into the new general statute of administrative procedure.\\n 16.

ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE IN JAPAN\\n A. A Brief Guide\\n The term \"administrative guidance,\" at one time considered bureaucratic\\n jargon, became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, especially through the\\n press coverage of the oil crisis in 1973.19 The discussion of the phenome-\\n non started before the 1960s by administrative law academics, who had ex-\\n perience working with government officials, and numerous definitions of\\n administrative guidance have been proposed since then. The most widely\\n used definition appeared in 1961 .20 It has also been one of the central top-\\n ics for observers of Japanese law.21 Administrative guidance covers a wide\\n range of voluntary communications, and is essentially a denotation for ac-\\n tions undertaken by a public official to persuade, either orally or in writing,\\n specific individuals or firms to behave in a certain manner. This type of\\n persuasion has often been subject to judicial inquiry in actions for damages\\n against the government, particularly the local government,22 under the\\n Verkuil, A Study of Informal Adjudicative Procedures, 43 U. CHI. L. REv. 739 (1976).\\n 18. In 1999, however, the Japanese national government has voluntarily (i.e., without\\n legislative mandate) started \"public-comment\" procedure for its rulemaking. Rules subject\\n to the procedure include not only legislative rules such as Cabinet orders, but also nonlegis-\\n lative rules and guidance outlines. The public-comment procedure is similar to the notice-\\n and-comment procedure provided in the APA. See 5 U.S.C. § 553 (1994).\\n 19. During OPEC\\'s embargo, the MITI gave informal directions to major Japanese oil\\n companies on their pricing and production, and these directions were described as \"admin-\\n istrative guidance.\" The oil companies\\' conduct under such directions were ultimately\\n brought to the court for alleged anti-monopoly law violations.

The law provides that only such actions as\\n may be characterized as dispositions that take immediate and imperative effect on private\\n rights or duties are reviewable in annulment actions. Examples of reviewable acts include:\\n firing public employees, issuing construction permits, ordering compliance, denying license\\n applications, and adjudging labor conflicts.

Within the Japanese national-local government system, which\\n is often characterized as cooperative or diffused,26 it is not uncommon for a\\n national government official to issue guidance to local government officials\\n regarding the business of the local government for which the national gov-\\n ernment has concerns. Such inter-governmental guidance, after a long ne-\\n glect, is now addressed by a major amendment of the Local Autonomy\\n Law, made in the summer of 1999.27 Administrative guidance vis-6-vis\\n private entities, addressing an indefinite number of people or entities, is\\n often undertaken in the form of an agency\\'s \"internal\" standards. When the\\n agency thinks it is necessary to issue a guidance in a consistent way to\\n many, or an indefinite number of, individuals or firms, it formulates a man-\\n ual which describes the standardized contents of the guidance. These\\n manuals are usually made public, and are known as \"guidance outlines.28\\n Guidance outlines are established so that the entire bureaucracy operates\\n under a uniform interpretation of the policy at issue. It seems that the ma-\\n jority of administrative guidance cases involve guidance outlines. Al-\\n though the APL does not include guidance outlines in the above-quoted\\n definition of administrative guidance, the APL does recognize both their\\n utility and problems. Article 36 of the APL provides standards of agency\\n conduct to be followed whenever an agency undertakes administrative\\n 25. Gy6sei-Tetsuzuki-H6 [Administrative procedures law], Law No. 88 of 1993. The\\n exempted category of \"disposition\" is defined as follows in Article 2(2) of the APL: \"(2)\\n Disposition: A disposition or other forms of exercise of public authority by an authorized\\n agency head or other officials.\"\\n 26.

See Shibaike, supra note 4; Young, supra note 3, at 931-32.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W RE VIEW\\n \\n guidance systematically, i.e., to an indefinite number of individuals or\\n firms: the agencies shall produce and make public guidance outlines.\\n Two elements are necessary in order to distinguish administrative guid-\\n ance from other agency actions vis-b-vis specific private entities. First,\\n there must be an act by a public official asking for voluntary cooperation.\\n Since the guidance is simply a request for voluntary cooperation from spe-\\n cific entities and does not have any legally binding effects, guidance out-\\n lines, characterized as an agency\\'s \"internal\" standards, are not legally\\n binding on private entities. Second, the request need not necessarily be\\n part of a specific administrative program that an enabling statute (or an\\n enabling local ordinance) has authorized an agency to implement.29 To be\\n sure, for jurisdictional purposes, it is generally thought that administrative\\n guidance should stay within its charter, or the \"duties and businesses\" of\\n each agency,30 as is also provided by the APL definition of administrative\\n guidance. Each enabling statute authorizes an agency to implement spe-\\n cific programs that fall within at least one of the agency\\'s \"businesses.\"\\n Thus, business provisions are to be amended to accommodate newly en-\\n acted enabling statutes that authorize new types of programs. Enabling\\n statutes and organizational statutes tend to be enacted separately. Only a\\n limited number of agencies are established under statutes that provide both\\n agency composition, \"businesses,\" and programs that should be executed.3\\'\\n The APL provides some substantive principles and procedural regulari-\\n ties regarding administrative guidance. The APL states that public officials\\n 29. It is generally thought, both in judicial opinions and literature, that administrative\\n guidance is not required to have a statutory basis in either substantive or procedural terms:\\n i.e., it is not required that relevant statute or local ordinances, explicitly or implicitly, pro-\\n vide for administrative guidance. This topic is discussed under the title of the \"basis in law\"\\n question. For an overview of the discussion, see Narita, supra note 5, at 60-64 and Yeo-\\n mans, supra note 5, at 147-58.\\n 30. In Japanese administrative law, the \"duties and businesses\" of an agency are distin-\\n guished from the agency\\'s statutorily authorized programs.\\n As a practice of legislation, each Ministry of the National Government is established\\n through its \"organizational statute\" such as the Establishment Law of the Ministry of Health\\n and Welfare. Organizational statutes not only provide for the Ministry\\'s composition, but\\n also describe \"businesses\" to be taken care of, or subject matter jurisdiction, using quite ab-\\n stract language. The Establishment Law of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, for in-\\n stance, provides that the Ministry shall take care of matters relating to water; improvement\\n and promotion of public health in constructions, etc. There are numerous enabling statutes,\\n on the other hand, that authorize each agency to execute specific programs. In the case of\\n the Ministry of Health and Welfare, enabling statutes include food laws, drug laws, waste\\n disposition laws, and pension laws. For a general discussion of the distinction between ad-\\n ministrative programs and businesses of the agency, see UPHAM, supra note 3, at 169. See\\n also Narita, supra note 5, at 64 n.48; Young, supra note 3, at 927 n. 12.\\n 31. The Fair Trade Commission under the Anti-monopoly Law is among the examples.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n must keep in mind that whenever they issue an administrative guidance,\\n voluntariness on the side of the addressee is always required. It also ex-\\n plicitly prohibits several guidance-related abuses. The abuses that the APL\\n prohibits include unfair, retaliative acts such as: an agency implying that it\\n might (1) otherwise revoke current licenses; (2) delay its action on current\\n applications, or (3) deny some other applications, even though it may not\\n do so under relevant statutes for reasons contained in the agency\\'s admin-\\n istrative guidance. These principles are basically a restatement of judicial\\n opinions regarding administrative guidance that appeared before the en-\\n actment of the APL. The APL further creates a procedural right for the ad-\\n dressee to have administrative guidance issued in writing.\\n B. A Fresh Look\\n The following examination of the concept demonstrates how the courts\\n and scholars have analyzed contextual differences in which administrative\\n guidance is undertaken.32 As a tentative model, the author has grouped the\\n Japanese discussion on administrative guidance into two categories, de-\\n pending on whether the agency, through administrative guidance, pursues\\n extra-statutory policy goals or statutory policy goals. In each category, at\\n least three different types of legal analysis to administrative guidance are\\n discerned from judicial opinions and academic literature. Each type of\\n category represents a set of legal problems arising from a unique context in\\n which a specific legal analysis is undertaken (see Figure 2).\\n \\n 32. See Takeshisa Nakagawa, Administrative Guidance: A Tentative Model of How\\n Japanese Lawyers Understand It, 14 KOBE U. L. REV. 1 (1998).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n FIGURE 2: A TENTATIVE MODEL OF JAPANESE LAWYERS\\'\\n UNDERSTANDING OF ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE\\n \\n ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE           ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE\\n GROUP A                           GROUP B\\n A Request for Voluntary Cooperation in A Request for Voluntary Cooperation in\\n Pursuit of Extra-Statutory Policy Goals  Pursuit of Statutory Policy Goals\\n Type I: Intervention in Private Con-  Type IV: Request for Consensus-\\n flicts for Negotiated Resolution    Oriented Decisionmaking\\n Type II: Action to Deal With Unex-  Type V: Expression of Discretionary\\n pected Extremities                   Judgment\\n Type III: Request for Cooperation with  Type VI: Bypassing Statutorily-\\n Agency\\'s Extra-Statutory Standards     Prescribed Proceedings\\n The first group, Group A, represents a collection of guidance that pursue\\n policy goals formulated by the agency, outside of legislatively authorized\\n programs, in pursuit of an agencies extra-statutory policymaking. This in-\\n cludes any policy judgment, or value of making balance among societal\\n forces, that has not been made by the legislature (the National Diet or local\\n government assemblies), but made solely by the agency, and the agency is\\n attempting to implement such policies by means of a request for voluntary\\n cooperation. Thus, the central question of Group A guidance is whether,\\n how far, and why at all, the agency may formulate and implement its own\\n extra-statutory policy goals.\\n The second group, Group B, denotes guidance undertaken by the agency\\n in pursuit of statutory goals. These goals are part of administrative pro-\\n grams authorized by the legislature. Statutory goals are not always imple-\\n mented formally; i.e., by the methods explicitly provided for in relevant\\n statutes or local ordinances, such as orders, permits, revocation of permits,\\n or rejection of applications. In practice, they are also implemented infor-\\n mally through a request for voluntary cooperation. As Professor John Ha-\\n ley demonstrates, informal implementation in this sense should be seen in\\n all legal systems.33 Japanese lawyers have also referred to such informal\\n implementation as administrative guidance. It should naturally be inferred\\n 33. HALEY, supra note 3, at 162-66.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n that Group B guidance vary greatly from Group A guidance. As a matter\\n of phenomenon, one administrative guidance can have both Type A and\\n Type B characteristics;34 theoretically, however, these two groups are dis-\\n tinguishable, and must be distinguished because they each present different\\n legal problems.\\n Within Group A, Type I (private conflicts) guidance represent the legal\\n reasoning given to the contextual features of the guidance, as demonstrated\\n in a Supreme Court decision in 1985.35 The opinion described the contex-\\n tual uniqueness of the case, in that the local government had interfered in a\\n private conflict by asking for amicable resolution through face-to-face ne-\\n gotiation between the parties to the conflict, without specific legal authority\\n to do so. The Court then implied that the addressee of such a guidance\\n would have a societal, not legal, obligation to try to cooperate with such\\n guidance. This way, the court showed its strong sympathy to the effective\\n implementation of the local governments extra-statutory policy goals to the\\n effect that certain types of private conflicts should be effectively settled.\\n Type II (extremities) represents extreme reasoning applicable to excep-\\n tional situations, such as the Supreme Court decision in Japan v. Idemitsu,\\n one of a series of the so-called Oil Cartel cases that occurred out of the oil\\n crisis of 1973.36 The Court held that even if the petroleum business fol-\\n lowed the Ministry of Industry and International Trade\\'s (MITI) informal\\n 34. Professor Haley quite accurately mentions this cross-over aspect of administrative\\n guidance. See id. at 163.\\n 35. See infra text accompanying note 42.\\n 36. 38 KEIsHu 1287 (Sup. Ct. Decision, Feb. 24, 1984). There is a volume of litera-\\n ture, written in English, on judicial judgments in the Oil Cartel Cases. See UPHAM, supra\\n note 3, at 184-88; see also Matsushita, The Legal Framework of Japanese Industrial Policy,\\n 1987 B.Y.U. L. REV. 541, 550-53 (1987); Matsushita, The Legal Framework of Trade and\\n Investment in Japan, 27 HARv. INT\\'L L.J. 361, 377-83 (1986); Ramseyer, supra note 19 at\\n 395. For a general discussion on the Japanese Antimonopoly Law itself, see Seita & Ta-\\n mura, The Historical Background of Japan\\'s Antimonopoly Law, 1994 U. ILL. L. REV. 115.\\n See also supra note 19.\\n It should be advised that the Supreme Court decision discussed in the text was handed\\n down on the pricing issue, which included administrative guidance on pricing. Another is-\\n sue was raised in the series of Oil Cartel Cases in relation to production arrangement among\\n petroleum businesses. The Tokyo High Court decided on this matter in 1980. See Japan v.\\n Association of Petroleum Indus., 983 HANJI 22 (High Ct. of Tokyo Decision, Sept. 26,\\n 1980). This case presented a totally different legal analysis of administrative guidance.\\n which from this Article\\'s perspective should be characterized as Type IV (request for con-\\n sensus) and Type VI (avoidance of statutory proceeding). The High Court decision first de-\\n nied that the Petroleum Industry Law provides any administrative guidance by which the\\n MITI may request the Association of Petroleum Industry to arrange production quota among\\n member companies. The Court then discussed that the statutory administrative guidance,\\n recommendation in the Petroleum Industry Law, may be bypassed by a de facto, \"prelimi-\\n nary\" administrative guidance. For the latter ruling, see discussion supra note 5.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n direction on their pricing, the illegality of cartel agreements among the pe-\\n troleum companies should be precluded in extremities. The opinion de-\\n scribed the uniqueness of the situation, in that emergencies existed that\\n were not at all expected at the time the relevant statute was enacted. These\\n contextual characteristics were treated as a strong excuse for MITI, not\\n only to formulate but also to effectively implement its extra-statutory pol-\\n icy goal to stabilize consumer prices of oil products. Here, the Court\\n showed even stronger sympathy to Type II (extremities) administrative\\n guidance than Type I (private conflicts). In contrast, the Type III (coop-\\n eration requested for extra-statutory standards) guidance, an agency\\'s re-\\n quest for cooperation with its own extra-statutory standards, is the residual\\n category of contexts in which the Supreme Court did not find any special\\n reason to be sympathetic.\\n In 1993, the Supreme Court presented a Type III analysis that impliedly\\n allowed the agency to make extra-statutory policy goals, but did not imply\\n sympathy to the effective implementation of such policy goals. That opin-\\n ion required total voluntariness on the side of the addressee of the guid-\\n 37\\n ance, apparently representing the absence of any contextual excuse.\\n It is the author\\'s impression that there is a tendency among observers of\\n Japanese law to focus on the administrative guidance at the national level.\\n However, judicial cases on such guidance have been quite scarce, the only\\n notable judicial opinions being the Supreme Court decision and the Tokyo\\n High Court decisions in the Oil Cartel Cases.38 As long-time experts on\\n Japanese law demonstrate,39 it is rather the guidance at the local level that\\n has formed the core legal doctrines of administrative guidance, and they are\\n what this Article calls Type I (private conflict) and Type III (cooperation\\n requested for extra-statutory standards) guidance.4°\\n Within Group B guidance, Type IV (request for consensus) guidance are\\n an agency\\'s request that private parties take part in consensus formation\\n with regard to the agency\\'s exercise of statutorily-granted discretion. Such\\n consensus-oriented methodology is usually not provided for in enabling\\n statutes. A central issue is whether the statute should at all be interpreted to\\n allow collaboration with private interests. This type of guidance is contro-\\n 37. See infra note 57 and accompanying text.\\n 38. See supra note 36 and accompanying text.\\n 39. See, e.g., RAMSEYER & NAKAZATO, supra note 13, at 205-12; UPHAM, supra note 3,\\n at 166-204; Young, supra note 3, at 926-32. All of these articles focus more on what this\\n Article calls Type I and Type III guidance.\\n 40. For example, Professor Hiroshi Shiono mentions two instances as representative\\n administrative guidance: the Department of Post and Telecommunication\\'s request for\\n shortening broadcasting hours for the energy conservation purpose and local governments\\'\\n intervention in private conflicts arising from construction of a high-rise apartment houses.\\n Shiono, supra note 20, at 221-22.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n versial because enabling statutes usually do not have the intention to allow\\n it; regular statutory interpretation is that, unless there are explicit provisions\\n to the contrary, the agency should exercise its discretionary power by itself\\n and should not bargain with private interests.\\n Consensus-oriented decisionmaking usually takes the form of collabora-\\n tion between the agency and relevant private interests. For example, it is\\n known that persuasion and similar communications occur between the\\n regulator and alleged violators in negotiation. Here, the regulator proposes\\n to exercise its discretion in a collaborative way. Both parties may discover\\n the best possible resolution to the offenses. There is an expectation in ne-\\n gotiation that the consensus to be reached will be incorporated into a for-\\n mal order. This communication is considered an administrative guidance\\n in Japan. What makes the methodology even more controversial is that\\n Japanese reality often dictates that the agency does not participate in the\\n collaboration. It virtually leaves the entire matter to private ordering, the\\n idea of collaboration to be dealt with only by the consensus among inter-\\n ested private parties.\\'\\n Type V (expression of discretionary judgment) guidance refer to the\\n situation in which the agency, after exercising its statutorily-granted dis-\\n cretion, has reached a conclusion that can only be expressed in the form of\\n persuasion; i.e., administrative guidance. Recent empirical research in Ja-\\n pan shows that in certain areas of administrative activities, such as fire pre-\\n vention, clean water protection, and industrial waste control, Japanese bu-\\n reaucrats have a strong tendency to only issue improvement orders against\\n exceptionally serious offenses. In all other less serious cases, the govern-\\n ment stops short of issuing orders, and instead simply gives guidance.\\n Japanese regulators thus tend to use administrative guidance to address al-\\n most all offenses, with no intention to further issue statutorily-authorized\\n orders even when the guidance is not voluntarily complied with. Research-\\n ers argue that such regulatory style has produced unsatisfactory enforce-\\n ment outcomes, and many offenses are not properly attended. Regulators\\n deal with statutory violations and generally have prosecutorial discretion as\\n to whether they will take adverse actions against violators. It can therefore\\n be said that Japanese regulators are exercising their prosecutorial discretion\\n in a very weak way, almost to the point of retreatism. Thus, what is re-\\n ferred to as an administrative guidance in this context is in fact an expres-\\n 41. See Frank K. Upham, Privatized Regulation: Japanese Regulatory Style in Com-\\n parative and International Perspective, 20 FORDHAM INT\\'L L.J. 396 (1996) (emphasizing\\n role of private ordering in the Japanese administrative process). In my argument, private\\n ordering appears both in Type I (private conflict) of Group A guidance and Type IV (col-\\n laboration) of Group B guidance.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n sion of the regulators\\' discretionary judgment, and the legal question to be\\n asked is whether the agency has abused its statutorily granted discretion.\\n Type VI (bypassing statutory proceeding) guidance is used when the\\n agency wants to avoid statutorily-prescribed proceedings. The purpose of\\n guidance is to obtain the same result with less cost. For instance, an\\n agency may, before issuance of a corrective order, first attempt to persuade\\n a regulated party into voluntarily correcting its alleged statutory violations.\\n The attempt to persuade is usually in the form of a discussion between the\\n regulator and the regulated party. If the alleged violator voluntarily follows\\n advice given by the regulator, the regulatory agency can easily bypass\\n statutorily-prescribed, and often resource-consuming, proceedings for is-\\n suing a corrective order. This attempt is not legally binding, and is char-\\n acterized as an administrative guidance. Legal topics related to Type VI\\n guidance, thus include: whether enabling statutes may be interpreted to al-\\n low bypassing statutorily-prescribed procedural protection, legal effects of\\n such informal settlement, and remedial questions that arise when private\\n parties, after following the agency\\'s advice, find that the advice was wrong.\\n When the agency undertakes administrative guidance, it can be analyzed\\n in the following way. As mentioned above, when Japanese regulators find\\n violations, they seldom take formal -  i.e., statutory -  actions immedi-\\n ately. The agencies would rather patiently keep talking to offenders in an\\n effort to persuade them to voluntarily correct the problem. This persuasion,\\n or administrative guidance, can be analyzed as Type IV (request for con-\\n sensus), Type V (expression of discretionary judgment), Type VI (bypass-\\n ing statutory proceedings), or even Type III (request for cooperation with\\n extra-statutory standards) guidance depending on the context. For exam-\\n ple, if the regulator discovers the offense is not very serious, and has de-\\n cided not to issue a statutory corrective order, then the guidance would be\\n classified as a Type V (expression of discretionary judgment) administra-\\n tive guidance, as the regulator exercised its discretion in a \"weak\" way, and\\n the sole issue is then whether there has been an abuse of discretion. If,\\n however, the regulator has internally decided to take formal action - such\\n as the issuance of a corrective order - but is attempting persuasion to al-\\n low the violator to voluntarily correct the problem, this would be classified\\n as a Type VI guidance (bypassing statutory proceeding). In this situation,\\n the regulator is simply trying to avoid the burdensome procedure for issu-\\n ing a corrective order, and legal issues include: whether or not the statute\\n can be interpreted to allow such avoidance in terms of procedural protec-\\n tion; whether or not legally binding effects arise from the talk between the\\n regulator and the offender; and what kind of judicial remedies are available\\n to the alleged offender if he later concludes that he has done nothing\\n wrong.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITYIN JAPAN\\n \\n The regulator may also simply want to talk about the details of its con-\\n templated corrective order so that the offender be given an order that is not\\n too difficult to comply with. This talk can be characterized as Type IV (re-\\n quest for consensus) guidance, and follows a legal question if such collabo-\\n ration may be valid in terms of statutory interpretation or fair exercise of\\n discretion. If the regulator finally issues the corrective order, which incor-\\n porates the consensus that has been reached, the talk is simply Type IV (re-\\n quest for consensus) guidance. On the other hand, it may be that based on\\n the negotiation, the offender voluntarily complies with the advice from the\\n agency on how to correct the offense. Then, the negotiation and the final\\n advice, which may not be readily distinguishable from each other in the re-\\n ality of administrative process, and thus may be seen as one administrative\\n guidance, must be analyzed to be partly Type IV (request for consensus)\\n guidance and partly Type VI (avoidance of statutory proceeding) guidance.\\n Finally, if the regulator asks for the offender, in such negotiation, to\\n comply with something beyond the statutes, this part of the talk should be\\n characterized as Type III (cooperation requested for extra-statutory stan-\\n dards) guidance, and the legal analysis is to be made accordingly.\\n Out of these several types of administrative guidance, it should be those\\n in Group A that seem more controversial. To help understand such prob-\\n lematic administrative guidance, two representative Supreme Court deci-\\n sions will be detailed in the next Part, from which the author has deduced\\n legal analyses respectively named as Type I (private conflicts) guidance\\n and as Type III (cooperation requested for extra-statutory standards) guid-\\n ance. These decisions represent an overall tendency, among judicial opin-\\n ions and literature, of positive evaluation of governmental activities outside\\n statutory authorization. As I have emphasized, these two have been the\\n center of attention in the Japanese administrative law literature.\\n III. Two REPRESENTATIVE CASES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR UNITED\\n STATES ADMINISTRATIVE LAW\\n A. Supreme Court Decision of 1985 (Nakatani) 42\\n 1. Background and Facts\\n In the 1960s, the population in major cities of Japan drastically increased\\n due to an economic surge. Necessary land-use regulation and other related\\n governmental measures could not catch up with the pace of population in-\\n 42. Nakatani v. Tokyo-To [Tokyo Metropolitan Government], 39 MINSI-Iu 989 (Sup.\\n Ct. July 16, 1985).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n crease. This resulted in mixed land uses in highly populated urban areas.\\n In those areas, problems such as sunlight, noise, and ventilation emerged in\\n the form of private conflicts between real estate developers and abutting\\n residents. Although the National Diet from time to time tried to respond to\\n such social hardships by amending relevant statutes,43 the amendments\\n were not powerful enough, leaving the problems virtually unattended.\\n Consequently, residents began to rely on local governments to manage the\\n problems.44\\n This type of problem is similar to a private conflict that would arise, for\\n example, from a real estate developer\\'s plan to construct a high-rise apart-\\n ment building. The regular course to follow for such situations would be a\\n resolution by either a face-to-face negotiation or an injunctive suit in court.\\n In Nakatani a third, and perhaps more convenient method was utilized. In-\\n stead of using the court system, opponent residents went to city hall and\\n appealed to administrative officers of their local government to attend to\\n their conflicts. There are many advantages, generally speaking, as opposed\\n to using the court system, or a face-to-face negotiation: (1) negotiation can\\n only be successful when both parties share the same concerns; (2) it is un-\\n likely the Court would issue injunctive orders against sunlight deprivation,\\n except for extreme circumstances; (3) civil procedures are costly, in both\\n time and money for most citizens; and (4) residents expect that the local\\n government, which has authority to grant permits to developers for con-\\n struction work, will have some persuasive power with developers - even\\n with issues not covered by the permit program in the statute.\\n It should be noted here that municipalities in Japan do not hold plenary\\n legislative power to regulate land use. This is perhaps different from their\\n counterparts in the United States. First, though the municipal government\\n is constitutionally guaranteed to enact local ordinances that may affect pri-\\n vate rights and duties, it may do so only when the ordinances do not con-\\n flict with existing statutes enacted by the National Diet.5 In other words,\\n local ordinances may create legal rights or duties only in the areas in which\\n national statutes do not preempt. Second, the Constitution of Japan does\\n set a limitation on the scope of legislative power vested in the National Diet\\n in terms of a guarantee of abstract \"local autonomy\" between the national\\n and local government relationship.46 It is generally believed that this guar-\\n antee is so vaguely drafted that there are virtually no specific areas or mat-\\n 43. See Kenchiku-Kijun-H6 [Building standard law], Law No. 201 of 1950 (amending\\n over 50 laws).\\n 44. For more details, see Young, supra note 3, at 929-32.\\n 45. See KENPO, ch. VIII, art. 94.\\n 46. See KENPO, ch. VIII, art. 92; Chih6-Jichi-H6 [Local autonomy law], Law No. 67 of\\n 1947, as amended in 1999.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n ters that are constitutionally reserved for local governments (or their as-\\n semblies).47 Third, based on the foregoing two constitutional provisions,\\n the Diet has continually enacted statutes providing for administrative pro-\\n grams (enforced either by national or local government agencies) that oth-\\n erwise could have been dealt with by local ordinances. The national stat-\\n utes are so comprehensively enacted, and the courts are so lenient in\\n interpreting the breadth of statutory preemption, resulting in national stat-\\n utes preempting local ordinance almost everywhere. Indeed, the local gov-\\n ernment is virtually unable to deal with new problems as a matter of legal\\n rights or duties through enacting local ordinances. Thus, even if the local\\n government determines that there are certain land use control problems, for\\n instance, and has ideas for solutions, because the national land use laws are\\n usually interpreted to preempt the land use area, it would be difficult for the\\n municipality to incorporate their ideas into local ordinances as a legally-\\n enforceable program. It follows that persuasion is the only alternative left\\n to the local government to implement its own idea of a solution. The local\\n government\\'s lack of legal authority doubtlessly constitutes the institu-\\n tional background against which administrative guidance of Group A, es-\\n pecially Type I (private conflicts) and Type III (cooperation requested for\\n extra-statutory standards), is issued by local government officials, often-\\n times based on guidance outlines. It is important to understand in Naka-\\n tani, that relevant statutes are generally interpreted to preempt problems\\n such as sunlight conflicts. Thus, the local government lacks power to enact\\n ordinances to deal with the situations as a matter of rights and duties.\\n The Nakatani case involved a real estate developer, who, in contempla-\\n tion of building an apartment in Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, applied to the\\n Building Inspector of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government for a building\\n proposal certificate, as provided for in Building Standard Law. The Law\\n requires that before starting construction work, owners of a proposed\\n building must obtain a certificate to demonstrate that their proposals are in\\n compliance with relevant statutes and local ordinances regarding technical\\n requirements on siting, structure, and facilities.48 Considering the technical\\n nature of the review process, the Law provides that the Inspector shall an-\\n swer applications within twenty-one or seven days depending on the type\\n of application.49 It is clearly the intention of the Law that the Inspector\\n shall not consider other, non-technical matters such as opposition from lo-\\n cal community.\\n In this case, however, almost one hundred abutters opposed the con-\\n struction proposal because of sunlight deprivation and tried to impede con-\\n 47. See HATA & NAKAGAWA, supra note 13, at 87-88.\\n 48. Kenchiku-Kijun-H6 [Building standard law], Law No. 201 of 1950, art. 6.\\n 49. Id. art. 3, no. 3.\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n struction work from the beginning. Instead of filing a legal action against\\n the developer, the opponents brought the matter to the Tokyo Metropolitan\\n Government; i.e., its local assembly members and the Division of Con-\\n struction Guidance - a department in charge of various construction-\\n related matters, basically technical matters - within the city hall. An offi-\\n cial of the Division phoned Nakatani to ask for an amicable resolution of\\n the conflict, and the developer agreed that during the negotiation, the appli-\\n cation for construction would be treated as if it were not officially on file.\\n The Building Inspector was informed of the agreement, and the Inspector\\n agreed to put his decision concerning Nakatani\\'s application on hold.50\\n Nakatani held several conferences with the opponent residents, and occa-\\n sionally informed officials in the Division about the meetings. Four\\n months after Nakatani first submitted his application, the developer was in-\\n formed that the existing zoning rules would soon be modified by the Tokyo\\n Government and that every future application for a building proposal cer-\\n tificate would include new and more stringent requirements. Since Naka-\\n tani\\'s application had been treated as if it were not on file at the time, his\\n application would eventually be reviewed under the new regulation. Thus,\\n a week later, Nakatani, attempted to avoid the new zoning regulation by\\n filing an administrative appeal to the Construction Appeals Committee of\\n the Tokyo Government, alleging illegality of inaction by the Building In-\\n spector on Nakatani\\'s application for a building proposal certificate. Be-\\n fore the hearing, however, Nakatani achieved a compromise with the oppo-\\n nent residents and proposed to drop the charges if the Inspector issued the\\n certificate immediately. A few days later, Nakatani dropped his appeal as\\n promised. In accordance with the compromise, the Building Inspector re-\\n viewed Nakatani\\'s application, found that it fulfilled all of the statutory re-\\n quirements, and issued the certificate. Although Nakatani was permitted to\\n finish the construction, he was not happy with the way the Tokyo Govern-\\n ment handled the case.\\n The developer then filed a tort action against the Tokyo Government,\\n seeking damages under the Government Tort Liabilities Law. Nakatani\\n alleged that the certificate should have been issued much earlier, at the\\n point when the Inspector could have reasonably reviewed the application\\n and could have found that the application was in compliance with relevant\\n requirements. He also asserted that the delay in issuance caused him seri-\\n ous economic injuries. Basically, due to the local government\\'s interfer-\\n ence, what was originally a mere private conflict between private entities\\n turned into tortious claims against the government.\\n 50. Although the Inspector and the Division officials were in no position to issue di-\\n rections to each other, they were both under the supervision of the Governor of Tokyo Met-\\n ropolitan Government. In this regard, their duties were coordinated.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n 2. Opinion and Analysis\\n The Court ruled in favor of Nakatani, using fairly complicated reason-\\n ing. The opinion first clarified the core issue of the case: whether delaying\\n a decision on a certificate application, later found to satisfy all of the re-\\n quirements of the Law and relevant regulations, constitutes a tortious act\\n performed by the local government. The Court held that withholding can\\n be legal (i.e., not tortious) when: (1) the applicant himself voluntarily\\n agrees that the application review process should be suspended (Rule A); or\\n (2) \"the circumstances in the case\" are such that would \"render reservation\\n of decision on the application, rather than the immediate issuance of cer-\\n tificate, a rational choice of action suitable to the societal common sense in\\n light of the intent and purposes of the relevant statutes\" (Rule B).\\n The Court found that Nakatani did not fall within Rule A, noting that,\\n although the developer followed the guidance and conferred with abutters\\n about the construction proposal, the evidence did not establish that the de-\\n veloper actually agreed to the suspension of his certificate application. The\\n Court proceeded to determine whether Rule B applied to the case. When a\\n local government official issues an administrative guidance asking a devel-\\n oper to reconsider the initial construction plan in order to negotiate with\\n abutters, and if an official withholds the certificate issuance for a reason-\\n able period of time to wait for the developer and opposing residents\\' com-\\n promise, the Court found that such suspension shall not necessarily be ille-\\n gal. The opinion further stated that, even though the administrative\\n guidance basically rests on voluntary cooperation, the withholding shall be\\n deemed illegal only if the developer shows in a \"clear and sincere\" way his\\n unwillingness to cooperate with the guidance and his objection to the sus-\\n pension of the application.\\n Under Rule B, the Court focused on how the applicant responded to the\\n administrative guidance, rather than on how the official conducted the\\n guidance. The opinion noted that the following facts were relevant to the\\n decision: (1) Nakatani held conferences with the opposing residents several\\n times in vain, leading to an impasse; (2) Nakatani was informed of the in-\\n troduction of a new zoning regulation with tougher requirements; and (3)\\n Nakatani, after these events, made an administrative appeal for immediate\\n action concerning his application. From these facts, the Court concluded\\n that the administrative appeal should be interpreted as a \"clear and sincere\"\\n expression by Nakatani of his unwillingness to further cooperate with the\\n administrative guidance. Nakatani was entitled to recover damages for the\\n injuries to his business that occurred after he filed the administrative ap-\\n peal, but not for any injuries that occurred before that date.\\n Readers should be intrigued by Rule B. While Rule A simply takes into\\n account free will on the side of private entities to the delay in their applica-\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n tion review process, mere.voluntariness is not the sole decisive factor under\\n Rule B. To render the delay illegal under Rule B, the applicant must not\\n only say \"no\" to the official, but also show his disagreement in a \"clear and\\n sincere\" manner. The applicant can only dissent effectively to the with-\\n holding when such dissent is considered to be not only \"clear,\" but also\\n \"sincere.\" The Court opined that tactical or emotional dissent should not\\n be considered \"sincere,\" and implied that dissent shall be judged \"sincere\"\\n after there is not a substantial chance of resolution. Public officials, on the\\n other hand, may reserve decision on the certificate application for a reason-\\n able time period until chances for conflict resolution actually vanish - as\\n immediate grant of the certificate is likely to destroy any chance for reso-\\n lution - and until the applicant shows unwillingness to continue to coop-\\n erate with the guidance in a \"clear and sincere\" way. Thus, it appears that\\n Rule B has the effect of transforming the intention of the Building Standard\\n Law into something different than intended. The Law provides that the ap-\\n plicant has a right to have his certificate application reviewed within a\\n relatively short period of time, and that the application shall be reviewed\\n only with reference to technical requirements in relevant statutes.51 After\\n Rule B, applicants can no longer simply ignore or decline to cooperate with\\n such administrative guidance.. In Nakatani, the Court illustrated its sym-\\n pathy to the effectiveness of administrative guidance through the sincerity\\n requirement in Rule B.\\n One can imagine that the sincerity requirement arose simply from the\\n notion that all conflicts in society need to be resolved, and that parties to\\n conflicts generally have some kind of obligation - certainly not legal, but\\n more likely moral or societal - to try to work together towards an amica-\\n ble resolution. There are at least two grounds, however, from which a dif-\\n ferent explanation can be inferred. First, one should note that the Court\\n does not apply its sympathy toward administrative guidance for amicable\\n resolution to all kinds of conflicts that occur in society. Sympathy is lim-\\n ited to such conflicts that the municipality has appropriately considered to\\n be serious social problems; the Nakatani opinion implicitly demonstrates a\\n concern for the kind of conflicts that the administrative guidance targeted.\\n The Court relies on two statutory provisions: (1) the general purposes of\\n local governments as provided in the Local Autonomy Law, which include\\n the \"prevention of pollution and other environmental matters, in addition to\\n the maintenance of public order and the preservation of safety, health and\\n welfare of residents;52 and (2) the ultimate purpose of the Building Stan-\\n 51. See Kenchiku-Kijun-H6 [Building standard law], Law No. 201 of 1950, art. 6, nos.\\n 2-3.\\n 52. Chih6-Jichi-H, Law No. 67 of 1947, art. 2. This provision was deleted, however,\\n in the 1999 amendment of the law.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n dard Law is \"to protect life, health and properties of the people, and thereby\\n to contribute to the furtherance of public welfare.\"53\\n Second, the Court did not require the local government official to act as\\n a genuine mediator or a neutral party. As a matter of fact, the negotiation\\n of the administrative guidance at issue is not a genuine conflict mediation\\n or a conflict management for several reasons. It is realistic to expect that\\n municipalities would interfere with such private conflicts that attract their\\n policy concerns. Also, from the viewpoint of the developer in Nakatani,\\n the official in the Division of Construction Guidance who issued the guid-\\n ance could never be considered neutral as he was in a position to success-\\n fully ask the Building Inspector to withhold Nakatani\\'s application. Fur-\\n thermore, the guidance that asked for a compromise was issued only to the\\n developer, while the municipality never urged the opposing abutters to\\n compromise their sunlight argument. After all, the purpose of the guidance\\n in Nakatani was not to genuinely mediate a conflict, but rather to persuade\\n the developer to understand the seriousness of the matter, and to alleviate\\n sunlight problems. Behind the administrative guidance requesting amica-\\n ble conflict resolution, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government had implicitly\\n formulated its own policy that the sunlight conflicts were to be resolved at\\n the burden of developers, even though such value judgment existed neither\\n in statutes nor local ordinances.54\\n At this point, the Court allowed local government agencies to make ex-\\n tra-statutory policy goals, with an attempt to explain the legitimacy of ad-\\n ministrative agencies making their own policy preferences without specific\\n legislative authorization to that effect, by citing the general purpose of local\\n government and the ultimate purpose of the Building Standard Law.\\n It remains to be discussed whether the Court has shown enough justifi-\\n cation for the extra-statutory actions. The Court simply pointed out that the\\n policy goals contained in the guidance were not in violation of existing\\n statutes. Despite this dubious aspect, the Court\\'s opinion in Nakatani has\\n been well received among Japanese lawyers, at least where local govern-\\n ment, land use control, and occurrence of a private conflict that was widely\\n considered a serious societal problem, are involved. Another factor that\\n should not be overlooked is that the official avoided giving specific direc-\\n tions on how the conflict should be resolved, and instead left the details of\\n 53. Kenchiku-Kijun H6 [Building standard law], Law No. 201 of 1950, art. 6.\\n 54. See Young, supra note 3, at 974-75 (discussing Court of Appeals decisions with\\n emphasis on judicial rearticulation of agency mandate from regulating sunlight to settling\\n disputes); UPHAM, supra note 3, at 175 (\"[Tlhe developer must bargain reasonably and in\\n good faith. The net result is the creation of a vaguely defined sphere of action ... within\\n which the city can operate to \\'encourage\\' developer compliance with land use policy that is\\n without any specific legal basis.\").\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n resolution to the parties. The local government allowed its vague policy\\n goals to be organized and developed by private parties through their nego-\\n tiation. The contextual uniqueness of Nakatani should perhaps be inter-\\n preted to limit the scope of the ruling, as the opinion only dealt with ad-\\n ministrative guidance - simply a request to negotiate towards an amicable\\n conflict resolution between private parties.\\n These contextual features and the accompanying reasoning in Nakatani\\n are what this Article calls Type I (private conflicts) guidance, where the\\n Court allowed administrative policymaking outside statutory authorization\\n and also recognized the effective implementation of such policy goals.\\n 3. Hypothetical Analogy in United States Administrative Law\\n One inquiry remains: whether any analogy to the above-described phe-\\n nomena and legal approach can be discerned in United States administra-\\n tive law. Indeed, how would American public officials, at any level of\\n government, respond if asked to interfere in a private conflict that is of so-\\n cial importance, but which has not yet been addressed by the legislature?\\n Moreover, if those officials responded in the same manner as Japanese lo-\\n cal government officials in Nakatani, how would American lawyers evalu-\\n ate such behaviors?\\n Professor Susskind and Mr. Field give insight into these questions in\\n their book on public dispute mediation, which discusses a case study of a\\n regional hospital relocation conflict.55 The case involved a conflict over\\n building a hospital. Abutters of the proposed site opposed the relocation\\n plan for various reasons, including ambulance noise and a decrease in\\n property value. The authors argue that the hospital should have approached\\n the opposing community, comparing the conventional \"decide-announce-\\n defend\" approach with what they call a \"mutual-gains\" approach. The\\n government\\'s role in the conflict resolution is quite intriguing. According\\n to the authors, a state regulatory agency \"rejected\" the initial proposal, and\\n \"urged the hospital to initiate a public advisory process and reconsider its\\n proposal.\"56 With some modifications, the hospital relocation case presents\\n the same contextual features as Nakatani.\\n One analysis is to suppose that the regulatory agency may legally refuse,\\n under relevant statues, a relocation plan as a final agency determination for\\n certain designated reasons, such as ambulance noise or property value de-\\n creases. With this modification, the \"rejection\" by the state agency will not\\n equal a formal agency determination, but will amount to the agency\\'s in-\\n 55. See LAWRENCE SUSSKIND & PATRICK FIELD, DEALING WITH AN ANGRY PUBLIC 39-\\n 40(1996).\\n 56. Id.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n formal dissatisfaction toward the initial proposal. Another analysis is to\\n suppose that the nature of the public advisory process urged by the agency\\n was not statutorily required. With this supposition, the agency\\'s insistence\\n to negotiate should be treated as a communication, inspired by the commu-\\n nities\\' outcry - to ask the hospital to listen to voices of the community. In\\n light of these two analyses, \"urging\" would be a counterpart to the admin-\\n istrative guidance conducted in Nakatani. In this hypothetical relocation\\n case, what would occur if the hospital was not satisfied with any of the new\\n proposals that might emerge from the public advisory process, and eventu-\\n ally wants to abide by its initial proposal? The hospital might think that the\\n delay in their relocation process was caused by the state government\\'s in-\\n terference in the conflict, and might sue the state for economic injuries -\\n assuming that one can seek tort remedies against the government under the\\n state law involved. Under these circumstances, we can see an exact paral-\\n lel to Nakatani, even though the actuality of these modifications and sup-\\n positions remains to be answered.\\n B. Supreme Court Decision of 1993 (Musashino-City)17\\n 1. Background and Facts\\n Eight years after the Nakatani decision, the Court addressed administra-\\n tive guidance once again in the Musashino-City case. This time, the cause\\n of administrative guidance was not a private conflict, but concerned budg-\\n etary difficulties within the local government itself. Here, the guidance\\n was much more authoritative in nature. Recognizing these differences, the\\n Court adopted a new framework to evaluate the validity of the guidance.\\n The Court simply declared that, where an agency requests private entities\\n to cooperate with its policy goals formulated outside legislative authoriza-\\n tion, total voluntariness is required of the recipient of the guidance.\\n Similar to Nakatani, the background of Musashino-City also related to\\n urban life during the steady economic growth of Japan. It became obvious\\n in the 1970s that suburban municipalities within commuting distance from\\n big industrialized cities had difficulty catching up with the abrupt increase\\n in population. These suburban municipalities experienced several prob-\\n lems, including the financial burdens imposed by statutory obligations to\\n provide for public facilities such as public schools, parks, and sewage sys-\\n tems. The municipalities were again without necessary legislative power to\\n resolve the problems, especially since relevant national statutes were inter-\\n 57. Takahashi Kikue v. Musashino-shi [Musashino City], 36 MINsHu 727 (Sup. Ct.,\\n Apr. 23, 1993).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n preted to preclude municipalities from imposing monetary duties such as\\n exactions or impact fees. Municipalities lacked power to create judicially-\\n enforceable duties through local ordinances, and were unable to deal with\\n their own financial difficulties. Thus, the municipalities had no alternative\\n but to ask developers (who were regarded as responsible for bringing in\\n new residents) to help with the financial burdens. As explained previously,\\n to avoid the national statute preemption problem, relief may not be in the\\n form of legal duties, but can consist of voluntary contributions from the de-\\n velopers.\\n Many suburban municipalities recognized the need to systematize their\\n officials\\' conduct in asking for cooperation from private entities, and there-\\n fore formulated guidance outlines, often called \"Guidance Outlines Re-\\n garding Residential Development.\" Such guidance outlines typically pro-\\n vide for: (1) the formula used to calculate the amount of monetary\\n contributions to be requested, and (2) the petition to obtain consent from\\n nearby residents, regardless of whether there actually exists a conflict con-\\n cerning construction proposals. These guidance outlines may be charac-\\n terized as a declaration by the local government of its policy goals that\\n those who cause increased local financial burden should make payments to\\n the municipalities for such costs. This particular policy has not been\\n authorized to any agencies at the local government level by statutes or local\\n ordinances, but is extra-statutory policy as formulated and only declared in\\n the outlines.\\n Outlines on residential development in suburban areas generally worked\\n well until the beginning of the 1990s, when developers easily transferred\\n the increased cost to the buyers because of steady economic growth. Still,\\n disputes took place between municipalities and developers, and some de-\\n velopers asked courts for restitution of money previously paid, or damages\\n alleging tortious acts by government officials. While no case for restitution\\n has been won by the developer-plaintiffs - perhaps due to some technical\\n reasons relating to the restitution doctrine - the Court in Musashino-City,\\n declared, for the first time, a possibility for developers to win their tort\\n cases.\\n The City of Musashino, a suburban municipality in Tokyo, created and\\n made public the \"Guidance Outline for Residential Development in the\\n City of Musashino\" (Outlines). The Outlines provided that developers pro-\\n posing a multi-family complex in the city \"shall\" contribute a certain\\n amount of money to the city for the purpose of assisting the city with its\\n obligation to provide for educational facilities. The plaintiff, who planned\\n to construct an apartment house, was requested by a city official to make a\\n monetary contribution in accordance with the Outlines. The plaintiff, a\\n long-time resident of the city, paid the prescribed amount of money. Later,\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n however, the plaintiff discovered the city would soon abolish some parts of\\n the Outlines, including the monetary contribution provision. Believing he\\n had been treated unfairly, he sued the Musashino City seeking restitution\\n and damages alleging tortious acts by the city official. Both the District\\n Court and the Court of Appeals denied restitution to the plaintiff on\\n grounds that there was no fraud or duress on the part of the city officials.\\n 2. Opinion andAnalysis\\n The Court rejected the restitution claim as well, but ruled in favor of the\\n plaintiff on his tortious claim. Compared to its ruling in Nakatani, the\\n opinion of the Court here was much simpler and shorter. The Court made\\n two points: (1) the city government, without any legislative authorization,\\n may set up a policy represented in the Outlines; and (2) that policy may\\n only be implemented by way of a friendly persuasion - asking for truly\\n voluntary payment of monetary contributions.\\n The opinion first noted that the city had experienced an abrupt increase\\n of construction of apartment houses since 1969, causing not only sunlight\\n deprivation and construction noise, but also had placed severe administra-\\n tive and financial burdens on the city government. Also, the Outlines re-\\n ceived complete support by the city assembly members when they met in-\\n formally, and were limited in their focus to construction plans that\\n exceeded a certain size.58 It appears that the Court attempted to rule on the\\n legitimacy of the city government\\'s policymaking, which was manifested\\n by the government in the Guidance Outlines. The Court was content with\\n the purpose, public support, and appropriateness of the informally formu-\\n lated policy preferences that required developers and future residents to\\n bear the financial costs on the city government.59\\n The Court then ruled on the way the guidance was conducted:\\n It shall not be illegal [for a local government] to request by way of administrative\\n guidance that developers make monetary contributions for educational facilities, so\\n 58. This meeting of the assembly members, called Zen\\'in-Kyogikai, is an informal ses-\\n sion of the assembly. As a result, any procedural requirements as provided in the Local\\n Autonomy Law, including the mayor\\'s convention proceeding, open discussion, and record-\\n keeping do not apply to Zen\\'in-Kyogikai. Thus, it is said that assembly members prefer\\n meeting informally for actual discussion of matters, rendering the formal sessions virtually\\n obsolete.\\n 59. See Young, supra note 3, at 966-67 (discussing lower court judgments with special\\n attention to Japanese courts\\' emphasis on their own recognition of societal consensus rather\\n than legally established procedures, such as local ordinances, regarding how societal policy\\n preferences can be shown). For an insightful discussion on societal consensus in Japanese\\n law, see Ramseyer, The Costs of the Consensual Myth: Anti-Trust Enforcement and Institu-\\n tional Barriers to Litigation in Japan, 84 YALE L.J. 604, 640-42 (1985).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W RE VIEW\\n \\n long as the request is made in such a manner as not to be coercive nor to impair oth-\\n erwise the voluntary nature of the actions on the side of the developers.60\\n The Court searched for signs of coercion, and concluded that the city of-\\n ficial threatened the plaintiff to make the payment. The Court emphasized\\n the fact that the official suggested to the plaintiff - in general terms -\\n that the city might suspend water supplies to the developers that did not\\n comply with the Outlines; and that the plaintiff\\'s request for a lesser\\n amount of contribution was flatly rejected by the official with a statement\\n that no \"precedents\" existed. The Court ruled that \"the city official in fact\\n coerced the plaintiff to pay,\" and his attitude was \"beyond that of adminis-\\n trative guidance which is simply a request for voluntary contributions.\"\\n The Court found that the city officials behaved inappropriately, as if the\\n Outlines constituted some kind of binding norms, and concluded that the\\n manner in which the city official conducted administrative guidance - a\\n demand for payment of monetary contribution - constituted a tort.61\\n In contrast to Nakatani, the Court looked carefully at the attitude of the\\n officials, and did not mention how the developer responded to the guid-\\n ance. The Court in Musashino City clearly required that guidance must be\\n a friendly persuasion made without coercion, and no special doctrine, such\\n as the one in Nakatani, was established to justify the use of administrative\\n guidance. There are at least two ways to understand the discrepancy be-\\n tween the Court\\'s holding in Nakatani and Musashino City. One possible\\n reading is that the Court simply changed its viewpoint on administrative\\n guidance. The other is that the discrepancy is due to the different factual\\n characteristics of each case. It is easy to understand why the Court ruled\\n differently if the contextual differences between the two cases are empha-\\n sized. In Musashino City, the local government explicitly made and stan-\\n dardized its own extra-statutory policy goals, in terms of payment of a\\n certain amount of money, and the government issued a guidance of a more\\n direct nature. In contrast, in Nakatani the official only formulated a vague\\n policy goal to the effect that sunlight deprivation should be appropriately\\n attended by constructors, leaving the details of the conflict resolution to be\\n resolved through private negotiation, thus rendering administrative guid-\\n ance of less direct nature. Therefore, two different legal analysis to ad-\\n ministrative guidance are shown by the Court: Nakatani represents a Type I\\n guidance (private conflict), while Musashino represents a Type III (coop-\\n eration requested for extra-statutory standards) guidance.\\n 60. Takahashi Kikue v. Musashino-shi [Musashino City], 36 MrNsHu 727 (Sup. Ct.,\\n Apr. 23, 1993).\\n 61 See id.\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n Theoretically, similar situations exist at the national government level as\\n well. While examples of these situations are abundant, they have not\\n reached the court system. An example of similar situations include two ac-\\n tions by the MITI: first, an issuance in 1952 of a recommendation that the\\n total monthly production of cotton yarn should be limited to 150,000 bales,\\n causing yarn manufactures to cut production; and second, a MITI policy to\\n ban oil importation, even though the relevant law at the time did not con-\\n tain provisions authorizing MITI to restrict oil product importation. This\\n caused the oil company to practically cease its project of importing oil\\n products.62 These are all examples of the government\\'s pursuit of allegedly\\n extra-statutory policy goals, with or without the use of unfair or coercive\\n methods of persuasion.\\n 3. Hypothetical Analogy in United States Administrative Law\\n Recent literature on United States administrative law often discusses\\n such phenomena known as the government\\'s \"raised eyebrows\" ap-\\n proach,63 \"arm-twisting,,64 \"jawboning,\" or \"friendly persuasion.\"65 Ex-\\n amples of situations discussed in these terms involve government officials\\n requesting private entities to cooperate with a certain concrete policy goal.\\n What is relevant in terms of this Article is whether agencies are specifically\\n authorized to pursue such policy goals. If agencies pursue a policy goal\\n that is not authorized, American courts analyze the phenomena in a manner\\n that is comparable to the way Japanese courts deal with Type III (coopera-\\n tion requested for extra-statutory standards) administrative guidance. If\\n agencies are authorized, then American courts should analyze the phe-\\n nomenon in a manner comparable to Group B administrative guidance\\n (Type IV (request for consensus) to Type VI (avoidance of statutory pro-\\n ceeding)).\\n The following is a hypothetical inquiry into how American courts and\\n commentators would respond to a government agency in its pursuit of ex-\\n tra-statutory policy goals when the agency does not act in a coercive man-\\n ner. The Federal Communications Commission\\'s (FCC) drug lyric policy\\n case in the early 1970s is a model for such an inquiry. In the 1970s, the\\n FCC issued a public notice reminding broadcasters of their obligation to act\\n 62. For further details and other arguably similar examples, see Steven M. Spaeth, In-\\n dustrial Policy, Continuing Surveillance, and Raised Eyebrows: A Comparison of Informal-\\n ity in Administrative Procedure in Japan and the United States, 20 OHIo N.U. L. REV. 931,\\n 935-37 (1994).\\n 63. See id.\\n 64. Lars Noah, Administrative Arm-Twisting in the Shadow of Congressional Delega-\\n tions ofAuthority, 5 Wis. L. REv. 873 (1997).\\n 65. See HEFFRON & MCFEELEY, supra note 2, at 213-14.\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W RE VIEW\\n \\n in the public interest, and to question the appropriateness of playing such\\n songs that glorify use of illegal drugs.66 The comment further suggested\\n that broadcasters should have people in charge of making certain judg-\\n ments as to whether each song they play potentially promoted drug use.67\\n Certain officials at the FCC even provided a radio station with a list of\\n songs which could be interpreted as having drug-oriented lyrics.68 Un-\\n happy broadcasters sued the FCC over these activities, alleging a First\\n Amendment violation and an illegal avoidance of rulemaking procedure of\\n the APA.69 A federal court decided the FCC\\'s statement merely required\\n broadcasters to have some knowledge of the songs they play.70 The court\\n held that there was no First Amendment issue in this case, and a rulemak-\\n ing procedure under the APA was not required.7 This holding, in effect,\\n allowed the FCC to formulate an important policy outside the APA\\'s pro-\\n cedural requirements, and commentators strongly opposed the ruling.72\\n Another example of the FCC pursuing an extra-statutory policy goal is\\n the FCC\\'s \"Family Hour\" policy. In the early 1970s, the national Parent\\n Teacher Association (PTA) and other groups brought their concerns about\\n explicit TV programs to the public\\'s attention. In response, the House Ap-\\n propriations Committee directed the FCC to address the issue. Although\\n the FCC Chairperson was concerned about the legal limitations on the\\n FCC\\'s role in this kind of issue, as well as limitations imposed by the First\\n Amendment and the Federal Communications Act of 1934, the Chairperson\\n eventually responded to the strong call from Congress. He talked to the\\n Vice-Presidents of the three national networks, and encouraged them to set\\n up their own policies, and also suggested that late night scheduling and\\n warnings to viewers should be included in such policies. The networks re-\\n sponded through the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) by\\n amending the NAB Code for Television Broadcasters to include the \"Fam-\\n ily Hour\" policy. Some producers and directors felt that this impeded their\\n freedom of speech and sued the FCC, the networks, and the NAB.\\n In discussing the role of the FCC, the district court made two points.\\n First, the Chairperson of the FCC actually \"threatened\" the networks.73\\n Second, the FCC formulated its policy outside APA procedural require-\\n 66. See Spaeth, supra note 62, at 947.\\n 67. See id.\\n 68. See id at 947-48.\\n 69. See id. at 947.\\n 70. See id.\\n 71. See id. at 948 (discussing Yale Broad. Co. v. FCC, 478 F.2d 594 (D.C. Cir. 1973)).\\n 72. See Spaeth, supra note 62, at 948-50 (noting reaction to federal court ruling).\\n 73. See Writers Guild of Am. West, Inc. v. FCC, 423 F. Supp. 1064, 1155 (C.D. Cal.\\n 1976) (finding actions by FCC constituted coercive threats beyond agency\\'s authority).\\n \\n [52:1\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN JAPAN\\n \\n ments.7 The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, dismissed the case on\\n the basis of primary jurisdiction.5 For the purpose of this Article, it is\\n worth noting that the district court emphasized the fact that the FCC cre-\\n ated its own policy, without reference to its statutory authority. The court\\n seemed content to limit the \"Family Hour\" policy to the FCC\\'s power un-\\n der the Federal Communications Act, the Administrative Procedure Act,\\n and the Constitution. The critical question, from the viewpoint of this Arti-\\n cle, is whether the district court would have ruled the same if the request\\n from the Chairperson was not a threat, and was voluntarily accepted by the\\n networks.\\n The Musashino City court discretely formulated a method for dealing\\n with a similar issue. The Court allowed agency policymaking without spe-\\n cific legislative authorization as long as the addressees voluntarily agreed\\n to follow the policy. The Court\\'s reference to the informal public support\\n for the content of the policy goal contained in the Outlines, however, indi-\\n cated that the Court noticed legitimacy questions as to the policy substance\\n and thereby attempted to resolve the issues by resorting to societal consen-\\n sus. Though it is still unclear if societal consensus may be a justification, it\\n remains to be seen if the same reasoning could apply in the United States.\\n IV. ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMALITY IN COMPARISON\\n Now, let\\'s put the observations in Parts II and III in the tentative picture\\n of the formality-informality dichotomy described in Part I. Despite differ-\\n ently conceptualized dichotomy, there are apparently three phenomena in\\n administrative process that are commonly called informal, setting aside\\n how much similar legal analyses given to them. One analogy that can eas-\\n ily be drawn between discussions on administrative informality in the\\n United States and Japan is the agency\\'s internal, or non-legislative stan-\\n dards, such as interpretive rules and policy statements expressed typically\\n in circulars, bulletins, or manuals, which constitute an important part of\\n administrative informality in both nations. As to these standards, it is note-\\n worthy that, in the United States, discussion focuses on avoidance of rule-\\n making procedure provided for in the APA, while Japan has no such dis-\\n cussion simply because of lack of such general procedural requirements\\n concerning rulemaking.76 Thus, comparison between legal analyses given\\n 74.

Though the FDA does not have an\\n explicit statutory authority to order a recall, it has, as the document makes\\n clear, authority to confiscate defective products. FDA\\'s request for recall,\\n in this regard, can be characterized as a substitute to the confiscation pro-\\n cedure that obtains the same results but costs less. In this sense, a \"Recall\\n Policy\" should be regarded as a counterpart to Japanese guidance outlines\\n for Type VI (avoidance of statutory proceeding) within Group B adminis-\\n trative guidance. Consider, on the other hand, the situation where the FDA\\n requests to recall products whose defects are not as serious as may legally\\n authorize the FDA to confiscate; or are not at all of such nature as ad-\\n dressed in relevant statutes, but the nature of the recall is such that society\\n might consider the products to be dangerous. Then, it is comparable to\\n Type III (cooperation requested for extra-statutory standards) guidance or\\n its Outlines. It is not certain whether American courts in those cases would\\n flatly deny such recall requests, even if the FDA asks for a genuinely vol-\\n [hereinafter Anthony, Agency Effort]; Kevin W.

These standards are perhaps what sparked administra-\\n tive law academics\\' interest in problems with administrative informality in\\n the earliest days. It may safely be said that negotiation efforts in the United\\n States\\' administrative processes bear a substantial similarity to the Japanese\\n administrative guidance of Group B, especially Type IV (request for con-\\n sensus) and Type VI (bypassing statutorily prescribed proceedings). Some\\n of these negotiation efforts include: the experimental negotiations con-\\n ducted in the EPA\\'s permit and regulation processes,82 the alternative\\n methods of conflict resolution as provided for in the Administrative Dis-\\n pute Resolution Act,83 and the Negotiated Rulemaking Act.84\\n Also included is the settlement process provided for in section 554(c) of\\n the APA,85 which calls for preliminary conferences to be held in order to\\n exclude issues that are not in genuine controversy from the adjudicative\\n hearing. Section 554 (c) of the APA provides as follows:\\n The agency shall give all interested parties opportunity for-\\n (1) the submission and consideration of facts, arguments, offers of settlement, or\\n proposals of adjustment when time, the nature of the proceeding, and the public in-\\n terest permit; and\\n (2) to the extent that the parties are unable so to determine a controversy by consent,\\n hearing and decision on notice and in accordance with sections 556 and 557 of this\\n title.86\\n These provisions are intended to oblige the agency to utilize the formal\\n procedure of adjudication only after issues have been reduced to the ones\\n of genuine differences through consultation.87 In his lecture in 1941, Pro-\\n fessor Walter Gellhorn gave examples of avoidance of procedural formali-\\n ties, and included: informal settlement procedure in complaint cases; in-\\n formal deficiency letters; supplemented by equally informal conference in\\n application cases; and informal opportunity for discussion towards consent\\n \"under the guidance of an official of the agency\" in private cases such as\\n workers\\' compensation.88\\n 82.

WALTER GELLHORN, FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS 47-60 (1941).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW RE VIEW\\n \\n \"Arm-twisting\" by government employees, as discussed in Professor\\n Lars Noah\\'s recent article,89 could be American counterparts to Type VI\\n guidance (request for consensus) or Type VI (avoidance of statutory pro-\\n ceeding) guidance, both within Group B, if the agency is pursuing statutory\\n goals in the form of persuasion. If, however, the agency is requested to\\n comply with extra-statutory conditions, arm-twisting is comparable to the\\n administrative guidance of Group A.90 In this sense, Professor Noah quite\\n appropriately mentions the Japanese regulatory practice of pursuing extra-\\n statutory goals in his article.91 His own understanding of arm-twisting,\\n however, is that there shall be no room for the agency to pursue extra-\\n statutory policy goals; thus, this American phenomena should be analogous\\n only to Type IV (request for consensus), or to Type VI (bypassing statuto-\\n rily proceeding) guidance within Group B. Professor Noah proposes that\\n arm-twisting should be limited through the utilization of the doctrine of un-\\n constitutional conditions doctrine and ultra vires doctrine, as well as\\n through reforming administrative procedure.92 It seems that he is attempt-\\n ing to limit arm-twisting within each agency\\'s statutory programs, and if\\n the arm-twisting cannot be regarded as part of statutorily delegated pro-\\n grams, such activity should be treated as illegal in the sense that it is not\\n authorized by relevant statutes by resorting to either the doctrine of uncon-\\n stitutional conditions or ultra vires. His proposal for procedural reform\\n also appears to represent his supposition that arm-twisting must always be\\n within the scope of statutory authorization. It is estimated that Americans\\n may be more concerned with statutory authorizations caused by arm-\\n twisting than with exploring possibilities towards positive evaluation, in\\n certain contexts, of administrative pursuit of extra-statutory policy goals\\n that have no basis, or authorizing provisions, in statutes or local ordinances,\\n but that do not straightforwardly violate any existing statutes or local ordi-\\n nances.\\n CONCLUSION\\n Japanese lawyers would certainly agree with Professor Rakoff\\'s first hy-\\n pothesis that the half-formal, half-informal procedure is generally regarded\\n 89. Noah, supra note 64, at 876-95, 899-908 (arm-twisting in licensing, government\\n contracting, voluntary recalls, adverse publicity, consent decrees, land use exaction, and\\n criminal plea-bargaining); Spaeth, supra note 62, at 940-54 (discussing telephone regula-\\n tion, broadcast regulation, and United States industrial policy).\\n 90.

It should be noted, however, such a statement would\\n not be made in Japan as an honorable retreat from the idealism of adver-\\n sarialness, but rather an effort to install more procedural protection in the\\n administrative process. As to Professor Rakoff\\'s second hypothesis, it is\\n sometimes argued in Japan, that lack of substantive rules should be reme-\\n died by some kind of procedural requirement. However, it may be that, to\\n realize the second hypothesis, it is necessary to have the strong tradition of\\n legalism that emphasizes adversarial procedural formats as a principal re-\\n quirement of rule of law. Otherwise, it may be hard to generally require\\n significant procedural substitutions to substantive rules.\\n In concluding this Article, I feel obliged to point out that there exists an\\n ultimate parallel between the United States and Japan despite different\\n types of thinking in informality discussion and different concepts of rule of\\n law, as has been discussed so far. Both nations are struggling with their\\n ambivalent feelings concerning what each traditionally prefers. Intensive\\n and extensive inquiries into administrative informality by Japanese legal\\n academics can be understood as a representation of Japanese ambivalent\\n feelings towards such informal activities. A positive value of substantive\\n informality in governance is considered to be that the government may be\\n able to provide a quick and flexible way of pursuing public purposes, al-\\n though fear of erosion of the rule of law and accompanying vagueness can\\n never be denied. Such vagueness not only raises a question of legitimacy,\\n but also can lead to inefficiency and unfairness, rather than flexibility and\\n satisfaction. These ambivalent feelings do exist among Japanese lawyers.\\n As a result, the utility of informality is praised, while informality is argued\\n against as a deviation from the path of the rule of law. A parallel seems to\\n exist in the United States, evident in the fact that Americans have a strong\\n tradition of formalism in governance, but they, from time to time, become\\n critical of the increases in cost and inefficiency caused by over-\\n judicialization.93\\n \\n 93.

As a prominent professor of labor law3 at one of the nation\\'s\\n top law schools4 and long-time arbitrator,5 Gould was clearly smart and\\n well-versed in labor issues. Moreover, in a field traditionally divided be-\\n 1. See White House Names Professor Gould of Stanford University to Labor Board,\\n 1993 Daily Lab. Rep. (BNA) No. 123, at A4-A5 (June 29, 1993). As a formal matter, the\\n President nominated Gould to the Board and announced his intent to designate Gould as\\n chair upon his confirmation by the Senate. See id. While nominations to the Board require\\n Senate confirmation, the president selects the chair from among the Board members without\\n need of separate Senate approval. See National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) § 3(a), 29\\n U.S.C. § 153(a) (1994).\\n 2. See, e.g., 140 CONG. REc. S3554 (daily ed. Mar. 2, 1994) (statement of Sen. Met-\\n zenbaum) (\"Professor Gould stands out as perhaps the most qualified nominee in the history\\n of the NLRB.\"); 140 CONG. REc. S3557 (daily ed. Mar. 2, 1994) (statement of Sen. Ken-\\n nedy) (asserting that Gould \"may well be the best qualified chairman ever nominated to the\\n Board\"); see also infra notes 68, 71 and text accompanying notes 72-73 (setting forth fur-\\n ther effusions regarding Gould\\'s extraordinary qualifications).\\n 3. See Steven Greenhouse, Parting Shots by Labor Board Chief, N.Y. TIMES, July 23,\\n 1998, at A22 [hereinafter Greenhouse, Parting Shots] (stating that Gould entered chairman-\\n ship as \"one of the nation\\'s foremost authorities on labor law\"). Gould was certainly well-\\n known in the field. See id. He was, for instance, one of the original ten members of the\\n Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations appointed in 1993 by the sec-\\n retaries of labor and commerce, the so-called \"Dunlop Commission.\" See Reich, Brown\\n Announce New Panel to Examine Workplace Cooperation, Employee Participation, 1993\\n Daily Lab. Rep. (BNA) No. 56, at AA-1 (Mar. 25, 1993). Moreover, his nomination to the\\n Board was supported by a veritable who\\'s who in legal academia; in a letter to the Senate,\\n 75 prominent labor law professors deemed Gould \"an outstanding leader in labor relations\\n [who is] uniquely qualified for this critical position.\" 140 CONG. REc. S3554 (daily ed. Mar.\\n 2, 1994) (statement of Sen. Metzenbaum) (quoting letter signed by 75 labor law professors);\\n id. at S3567-68 (listing signatories).\\n 4. See FEDERAL YELLOW BOOK § 11, at 111-176 (Spring 1996) (indicating that Gould\\n taught at Stanford Law School from 1972-93).\\n 5. Gould was one of the youngest members ever admitted to the National Academy of\\n Arbitrators, having been admitted at the age of 33. See William B. Gould IV, of California,\\n to be a Member of the National Labor Relations Board: Hearings Before the Senate Comm.\\n on Labor and Human Resources, 103d Cong. 5 (1993) (statement of Sen. Boxer) [hereinaf-\\n ter Gould Hearings]. At the time of his nomination, he had been an arbitrator for almost 25\\n years. Id.\\n \\n 466\\n \\n [52:2\\n \\n  \\n THE GOULD YEARS AT THE NLRB\\n \\n tween labor on the one hand and management on the other, Gould brought\\n extremely strong credentials as a neutral to the table. In addition to having\\n spent the twenty-five years prior to his appointment in a non-partisan role,6\\n before entering academia Gould had worked for a union, a management-\\n side law firm and the NLRB7 -    a balanced record if there ever was one.s\\n Gould\\'s tenure, however, turned out to be an extremely troubled one.9 It\\n was entirely predictable, of course, that even a mainstream Democrat like\\n Gould\\'0 would not be a great favorite of the management community and\\n its Congressional allies; while they could certainly have done much worse\\n under a Democratic president,\" Board members are rarely if ever popular\\n with both sides. By midway through his term, however, Gould was the\\n object of much more than the routine complaints of the \"out-group;\" he\\n was under incessant and almost vicious attack from Congressional Repub-\\n licans and the employer community,12 and was being harshly criticized -\\n at least in private - by the union side as well.3\\n 6. That is, as an academic and arbitrator. See supra text accompanying notes 3-5.\\n 7. See FEDERAL YELLOW BOOK, supra note 4, at 111-176 (indicating that Gould was\\n Assistant General Counsel for United Auto Workers from 1961-62, an attorney with NLRB\\n from 1963-65, and an associate with Battle, Fowler, Stokes & Kheel from 1965-68); see\\n also Gould Hearings, supra note 5, at I (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (noting that Gould rep-\\n resented management for three years, the United Auto Workers for a year, and spent two\\n years with NLRB before entering academia); 140 CONG. REC. 3557 (daily ed. Mar. 2, 1994)\\n (statement of Sen. Kennedy). Moreover, during his academic career Gould had also repre-\\n sented individual workers in race discrimination suits against both unions and employers.\\n See id.\\n 8. Indeed, Gould\\'s range of experience appears to have been unprecedented for an\\n NLRB member. See infra notes 61-71 and accompanying text.\\n 9.

It also explores the extent to which\\n Gould\\'s fatal flaw - his evident lack of both internal and external political\\n skills - is traceable to his background in academia, and considers the\\n problem of pure \"merit\" appointments.\\n Part I explains why Professor Gould appeared so perfect on paper. It\\n begins by identifying the pools from which Labor Board members are typi-\\n cally drawn and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses that nominees\\n drawn from those pools are likely to bring to the position. It then discusses\\n Professor Gould\\'s professional background, and demonstrates how Gould\\n seemed to combine many of the respective strengths of the prototypical\\n nominees - private-sector labor lawyers and career government employ-\\n ees - while avoiding the primary weaknesses of each.\\n Part II assesses the extent to which the promise of Gould\\'s background\\n was borne out during his term. It first analyzes Gould\\'s decisional record,\\n and concludes that Gould\\'s balanced and varied background was a strong\\n predictor of decisional performance; Chairman Gould was not a predictable\\n \"pro-union\" or \"pro-management\" vote, but rather showed a great deal of\\n intellectual independence and creativity in addition to considerable practi-\\n cal expertise. Part II then describes the dark side of Gould\\'s tenure: his\\n penchant for speaking out on controversial issues and lashing out at his op-\\n ponents, and the Congressional reaction engendered thereby, as well as his\\n inability to get along with, much less lead, his colleagues at the NLRB.\\n Part III, finally, considers the extent to which Gould\\'s impolitic behavior\\n is attributable to his background in academia. It concludes that the evi-\\n dence simply does not support such an attribution, however tempting it\\n may be. Part III determines that the academics who have served on the La-\\n bor Board have been a decidedly mixed bag in terms of both internal and\\n external political skills, and that a legislative background is no guarantee of\\n smooth relations with Congress. It thus argues that political skills are\\n likely more a product of temperament and of what might be called a nomi-\\n nee\\'s \"internal reward system\"19 than of professional background.\\n This Article ultimately concludes that the lesson to be drawn from the\\n Gould years at the NLRB pertains not to the wisdom (or lack thereof) of\\n appointing academics to leadership positions, but to the dangers inherent in\\n pure \"merit\" appointments, and to the narrowly circumscribed meaning of\\n agency \"independence.\"  Chairman Gould repeatedly referred to the\\n 19. See infra text accompanying notes 270-71 (discussing concept of this reward sys-\\n tem).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n Board\\'s status as an \"independent\" federal agency and decried Congress\\'s\\n \"meddling\" with and \"intrusion\" into the Board\\'s affairs;20 in his view, the\\n quasi-judicial NLRB21 is analogous to the federal judiciary22 and was enti-\\n tled to hands-off treatment from    Congress as well as the President.23\\n Gould\\'s supposition, of course, could hardly have been more mistaken. No\\n federal agency -   whether \"independent\" or \"executive\\'24 -   operates in-\\n dependently of Congress, which controls its budget and therefore its life-\\n blood, and has an array of other weapons at its disposal for use against \"un-\\n cooperative\" agencies.25\\n In failing to recognize this reality and to conduct himself accordingly,\\n Chairman Gould failed to fulfill an essential element of his role as NLRB\\n chairman: that of providing political leadership of the agency. The NLRB\\n may be \"quasi-judicial,\" but Gould\\'s duties as head of the agency were in\\n no way limited to producing high-quality opinions; to the contrary, they\\n necessarily included \"creat[ing] a climate of acceptance for [the agency\\'s]\\n activities\"26 and \"win[ning] popular support for the agency\\'s programs\\'27\\n - two things that Gould most certainly did not do. If the Gould years at\\n the Labor Board tell us anything, it is surely that an agency head ignores\\n this political role at not only his own but the agency\\'s peril, and that pure\\n \"merit\" appointments, however appealing on paper, are likely to prove dis-\\n appointing in the end.\\n 20. See infra notes 192-94 and accompanying text.\\n 21. See 62 NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD, ANNUAL REPORT 3 (1997) (stating\\n that five-member Board \"primarily acts as a quasi-judicial body in deciding cases on formal\\n records\"). The Board\\'s quasi-judicial character is accentuated by the fact that alone among\\n the major federal agencies, it very rarely engages in rulemaking, but rather makes almost of\\n all its policy, as well as applies that policy, through adjudication.

PERFECT ON PAPER\\n A. The Usual Suspects\\n In order to understand just why Professor Gould appeared to be a near-\\n perfect nominee on paper, it is useful to step back a bit and to consider the\\n typical professional backgrounds of Labor Board nominees, and the degree\\n and type of expertise likely to result therefrom. During the last three dec-\\n ades, at least, there have been two stock backgrounds for NLRB mem-\\n bers:28 labor lawyer in private practice29 (almost always management-\\n 28. Of the 26 Board members other than Gould who have been appointed since 1970,\\n 23 can be classified as either labor lawyers in private practice or career government employ-\\n ees. The other three, who are a bit more difficult to categorize, are current Board members\\n Sarah Fox and Wilma Liebman, and Betty Murphy, the first woman appointed to the Board\\n (in 1975) and the only woman ever to chair the NLRB. Fox and Liebman both spent many\\n years as union-side lawyers but came to the Board from government service. See infra note\\n 30. Murphy spent most of her career with an unusual law firm that represented several in-\\n ternational unions as well as numerous management clients. See Betty Southard Murphy, of\\n Virginia, to Be a Member of the National Labor Relations Board: Hearings Before the Sen-\\n ate Comm. on Labor and Public Welfare, 94th Cong. 3 (1975) [hereinafter Murphy Hear-\\n ings] (Murphy biography); id. at 15-16 (Murphy testimony). At the time of her appointment\\n Murphy had been serving as Administrator of the Department of Labor\\'s Wage and Hour\\n Division for a year and a half. See id. at 3, 15-16.\\n 29. Eleven of the last 26 Board members, excluding Gould, came to the Board from a\\n management-side practice. The management-side lawyers are: Edward Miller (1970-74),\\n Peter Walther (1975-77), John Van de Water (1981-82), Patricia Diaz Dennis (1983-86),\\n Marshall Babson (1985-88), Mary Miller Cracraft (1986-91), Clifford Oviatt (1990-93),\\n John Raudabaugh (1990-93), Charles Cohen (1994-96), J. Robert Brame (1997-present) and\\n Peter Hurtgen (1997-present). See THE FIRST SIXTY YEARS: THE STORY OF THE NATIONAL\\n LABOR RELATIONS BOARD, 1935-1995 56 (1995) [hereinafter FIRST SIXTY YEARS] (listing all\\n Board members from 1935-1995 and terms of service); JAMES GROSS, BROKEN PROMISE:\\n THE SUBVERSION OF U.S. LABOR RELATIONS POLICY 1947-1994 219-220 (1995) [hereinafter\\n GROSS, BROKEN PROMISE] (Miller); id at 231-32 (Walther); id. at 249-50 (Van de Water,\\n Dennis, Dotson); id at 386 n.176 (Babson); Court Gifford, Senate Confirms Four Clinton\\n Nominees Giving Labor Board Five-Member Complement, 1997 Daily Lab.

A twelfth Board member\\n whom I would classify as having a management-side background is Donald Dotson (1983-\\n 87).

See id. at 250.\\n 30. Thus far, the only person appointed to the Board directly from union-side practice\\n was Margaret Browning, who served from 1994-1997. See Member Margaret A. Browning\\n Dies of Cancer at Age 46, 1997 Daily Labor Rep. (BNA) No. 41, at A-10 (Mar. 3, 1997).\\n Two of the current Board members, Sarah Fox and Wilma Liebman, spent substantial\\n stretches as union lawyers earlier in their careers, but were serving in government positions\\n at the time of their appointment.

Ten of the last 26 Board members prior to Gould had spent all or most of their ca-\\n reers in government. They are: Ralph Kennedy (1970-75), John \"Doc\" Penello (1972-81),\\n John Truesdale (1977-8 1, Jan. 1994 to Mar. 1994, Dec. 1994 to Jan. 1996, Dec. 1998 to pre-\\n sent), Don Zimmerman (1980-84), Robert Hunter (1981-85), John Miller (Dec. 1982 to\\n Mar. 1983), Wilford \"Bud\" Johansen (1985-89), James Stephens (1985-95), John Higgins\\n (1988-89, Sept. 1996 to Nov. 1997), and Dennis Devaney (1988-94).

See GROSS, BROKEN PROMISE, supra note 29, at 245, 266,\\n 386 n. 176. Devaney had been a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board and Gen-\\n eral Counsel to the Federal Labor Relations Authority. See President Names Devaney to\\n Recess Appointment at Board, supra. The remaining six were career NLRB employees.\\n 32. See supra text accompanying notes 3-5.\\n 33. Carter\\'s two appointments to the Board were John Truesdale and Don Zimmerman.\\n Truesdale had spent the vast majority of his career with the Board. See GROSS, BROKEN\\n PROMISE, supra note 29, at 243, 378 n.5 (noting that Truesdale had spent all but six years of\\n his career with NLRB and at time of appointment was Board\\'s Executive Secretary). Zim-\\n merman had been a legislative aide to Senator Jacob Javits of New York on the Senate La-\\n bor and Human Resources Committee. See id. at 245. The \"holdover\" Board members had\\n \\n  \\n THE GOULD YEARS AT THE NLRB\\n \\n expertise to serve on the NLRB,35 and that only those with substantial ex-\\n perience representing management or labor at the bargaining table should\\n be appointed.36 While Hunter greatly overstated his case, I believe, experi-\\n enced management and union-side lawyers do bring a wealth of practical\\n experience to the Board, and undoubtedly have an edge over those with no\\n experience in private practice in three key areas.\\n First, because they have been directly involved in contract negotiations,\\n management and union-side lawyers are much better qualified than are ca-\\n reerists to assess the real-world impact of Board doctrine regarding the duty\\n to bargain37 on union and management behavior. Second, they will have a\\n better sense of the day-to-day functioning of the workplace and a better\\n grasp on issues of contract administration than their governmental counter-\\n parts. This is so because while Board employees see only workplaces that\\n are in a state of flux due to a union organizing campaign or that are not\\n \"working\" in the sense that matters have culminated in litigation,38 union\\n also had made their careers primarily in government. See Warren C. Ogden, An Impasse in\\n Decisionmaking, 31 LAB. L.J. 559, 559 (1980) (reporting that Truesdale and Zimmerman\\n join Chairman John Fanning, a Board member since the 1950s; Member Howard Jenkins, a\\n Board member since 1963; and career Board employee John Penello).\\n 34. Hunter was appointed in 1981. See CONGRESSIONAL QUARTERLY, FEDERAL\\n REGULATORY DIRECTORY 379 (1984).\\n 35. See Robert P. Hunter, The Department of Labor, in MANDATE FOR LEADERSHIP:\\n POLICY MANAGEMENT IN A CONSERVATIVE ADMINISTRATION 453, 494 (Charles L. Heatherly\\n ed., 1981) (claiming that perception of Board\\'s expertise is at all-time low because Carter\\n Board members are \"government bureaucrats\" with no substantial experience representing\\n private sector clients; \"[w]ithout actual experience on the firing line, the expertise of Board\\n members must be, at best, academic with an \\'ivory tower\\' slant\"); see also Ogden, supra\\n note 33, at 559-60 (arguing that Carter Board can make no claim to expertise since none of\\n its members have private sector collective bargaining experience).\\n 36. See Hunter, supra note 35, at 494. Interestingly, this did not prevent Hunter, who\\n himself lacked any such experience, from accepting an appointment to the Board from\\n President Reagan the following year. See CONGRESSIONAL QUARTERLY, supra note 34, at\\n 379 (indicating that prior to his appointment in 1981, Hunter had served for five years as an\\n NLRB attorney, and had then served first as minority counsel and later as majority counsel\\n to the Senate Labor Committee).\\n 37. See NLRA § 8(a)(5), 29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5) (1994) (stating that employer that re-\\n fuses to bargain collectively with employees\\' representative commits unfair labor practice);\\n id. § 8(d), 29 U.S.C. § 158(d) (providing that duty to bargain collectively requires parties to\\n meet and confer in good faith regarding wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of\\n employment).\\n 38. Cf W. Willard Wirtz, On Teaching Labor Law, 42 ILL. L. REV. 1, 4 (1947) (argu-\\n ing that \"the study of labor litigation offers no real insight into the basic laws of decent la-\\n bor relations.\") (emphasis in original); see also Merton C. Bernstein, The NLRB\\'s Adjudi-\\n cation-Rulemaking Dilemma Under the Administrative Procedure Act, 79 YALE L.J. 571,\\n 577 (1970) (concurring with Wirtz\\'s observation that \"[sjeeing only diseased conditions ...\\n is a dubious way of becoming acquainted with healthy labor relationships\" and questioning\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n and especially management-side lawyers are exposed to workplace matters\\n on a much more continual basis. Third and finally, lawyers from private\\n practice will have a superior understanding of the grievance/arbitration\\n process, a process with which NLRB employees have no direct contact,39\\n and hence of its proper relationship to NLRB adjudications.0\\n This edge in practical expertise, however, is purchased at an extremely\\n high cost. Labor lawyers invariably represent one side or the other - not\\n both41 -  and it is difficult to see how nominees who have made a career\\n out of representing either unions or management can render an \"unbiased\"\\n opinion on issues of national labor policy.42 This is so not only because of\\n whether \"[the Board\\'s] limited diet is nutritious\").\\n 39. That is, whereas management and union lawyers advise their clients on grievance\\n handling and participate directly in arbitration hearings, Board employees see the griev-\\n ance/arbitration process only before and after the fact, and on paper only. See infra note 40\\n (discussing Board\\'s practices of deferring unfair labor practice or \"ULP\" cases to griev-\\n ance/arbitration process, and of post-arbitral deference to arbitral awards).\\n 40. The degree to which the Board should defer ULP cases to the grievance/arbitration\\n process - i.e., require a charging party to first pursue the grievance-arbitration process\\n where the conduct complained of may be a violation of the collective bargaining agreement\\n as well as the NLRA - has been among the most hotly contested issues under the Act, es-\\n pecially in regard to charges alleging violations of employees\\' individual statutory rights\\n under NLRA sections 8(a)(l) and 8(a)(3). See generally United Technologies Corp., 268\\n N.L.R.B. 557 (1984) (recounting Board\\'s history of oscillation in area of pre-arbitral defer-\\n ral and, over heated dissent, overruling more recent precedent and returning to rule that\\n charges involving allegations of coercion under section 8(a)(1) and anti-union discrimina-\\n tion under section 8(a)(3) will, like charges alleging unlawful unilateral changes in working\\n conditions under section 8(a)(5), be deferred to grievance/arbitration process as long as dis-\\n pute is clearly cognizable under contractual grievance-arbitration clause and employer has\\n indicated willingness to arbitrate). See also MICHAEL C. HARPER & SAMUEL ESTREICHER,\\n LABOR LAW: CASES, MATERIALS AND PROBLEMS 875-76 (4th ed. 1996) (noting long-time\\n controversy on Board and extensive literature spawned by pre-arbitral deferral issue). The\\n degree of deference that the Board should give to an arbitral award once rendered in adjudi-\\n cating a ULP case based on the same underlying facts has also been an area of much dis-\\n pute. See Olin Corp., 268 N.L.R.B. 573 (1984).\\n 41. See Agency in Crisis, supra note 15, at 50; see also Edward B. Miller of Illinois, to\\n be a Member of the National Labor Relations Board Hearings Before the Senate Comm. on\\n Labor and Public Welfare, 91st Cong. 30-31 (1970) (testimony of Mr. Miller) (stating that\\n only a few attorneys represent both management and labor; generally firms represent one\\n side or the other). Former Board Chair Betty Murphy is among the few to have worked for\\n a law firm that represented both sides. See Murphy Hearings, supra note 28, at 14 (state-\\n ment of Sen.

Given\\n 43. See PAUL H. DOUGLAS, ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT 49 (1952) (referring to the \"[Ijure\\n of [plast and [fluture [e]mployment\" as one of the most severe temptations of administra-\\n tors).\\n 44. See William M. Landes & Richard A. Posner, The Independent Judiciary in an In-\\n terest-Group Perspective, 18 J.L. & ECON. 875, 886 n.22 (1975) (noting that a federal judi-\\n cial appointment is generally a terminal job; most federal court judges die while still on the\\n bench, and the average tenure during period 1949-65 was 25 years). It is true that the per-\\n centage of federal judges serving out their careers on the bench may decline a bit in future\\n years given the tendency of some recent presidents, most notably Ronald Reagan, to appoint\\n much younger men and women as judges than was formerly the norm. See Judy Mann, In-\\n defensible Distinctions, WASH. POST, Oct. 9, 1992, at E3 (noting that Reagan and Bush judi-\\n cial appointees tended to be quite young). However, the majority of federal judges are\\n likely to continue to end their careers on the bench, and given the extremely brief terms that\\n NLRB members serve in comparison, see infra note 45, my overall point remains unaffected\\n by this phenomenon.\\n 45. The full term of an NLRB member is five years, but an individual chosen to fill a\\n vacancy is appointed only for the remainder of her predecessor\\'s unexpired term. See\\n NLRA § 3(a), 29 U.S.C. § 153(a) (1994). Moreover, in recent years there has been a strik-\\n ing increase in the number of recess appointees, who by definition may serve only until the\\n end of the next session of the Senate, and reappointment of Board members has become al-\\n most unheard of.

(BNA) No. 104, at\\n A-8 (June 1, 1998) (reporting Hurtgen comments that \"he was appointed because of his 30\\n years as a management advocate and that he and Member J.

They don\\'t.\"51\\n As a realistic matter, Board members who have come from the manage-\\n ment or union side and are doubtlessly headed right back there at the end of\\n their term are almost certain to be locked into the \"management\" or \"un-\\n ion\" view of important policy issues from the outset. While they will\\n doubtless draw on their years of experience in the trenches in making the\\n best case for their side\\'s position on a particular issue, they are hardly\\n likely to draw on this experience to bring to light practical arguments\\n against that position. Moreover, they are even less likely to actually vote\\n for any policy that would be disfavored by their side - no matter what\\n their experience may tell them about the practical implications of, fairness\\n and Wilma B. Liebman, former union advocates, and Chairman William B. Gould, a law\\n professor perceived as pro-union, and that he is \\'\"eager to right the balance,\"\\' but proce-\\n dural posture of cases reaching Board thus far had left him unable to address many substan-\\n tive issues as of yet). A recent article by former Board Chair and long-time management\\n attorney Ed Miller makes clear that Hurtgen is still perceived as part of the management-\\n side \"club.\" See Miller, Good News and Bad News, supra note 46, at 1052 (referring in ar-\\n ticle recounting \"good news and bad news for employers\" to \"[ojur good friend, Member\\n Hurtgen\").\\n 49.

This is not to say that Board members drawn from private practice are the only\\n ones who perceive themselves as having a constituency; as discussed infra text accompa-\\n nying notes 279-282, the same is likely to be true of members who come from a particular\\n ideological community. Nor are members from other backgrounds immune from outside\\n pressures of other kinds. For instance, Board members seeking or at least hoping for\\n reappointment may be tempted to adjust their positions accordingly. See GROSS, BROKEN\\n PROMISE, supra note 29, at 242-43 (reporting that other Board members privately grumbled\\n that Nixon appointee Betty Murphy tilted her opinions in pro-union direction following\\n President Carter\\'s election in attempt to obtain reappointment to Board and to retain posi-\\n tion as Board Chair).

By \"objective,\" I do not mean that they will lack opinions or leanings\\n of any kind; anyone with any experience in the field is bound to have some\\n firm opinions and tendencies in one direction or the other.53 What I am re-\\n ferring to, rather, is fair-mindedness or lack of bias.\\n Those who have spent their careers in the middle of labor-management\\n disputes rather than on one side or the other are significantly better bets\\n than ex-management and union lawyers to give serious consideration to the\\n arguments on both sides before making up their minds on important policy\\n questions, as opposed to quickly searching for the strongest rationale to\\n support a pre-determined bottom line. Moreover, careerists are not subject\\n to the same sort of prospective peer pressure undoubtedly felt by manage-\\n ment and union-side advocates facing a return to private practice. Because\\n they do not come from one community or the other, they have no natural\\n \"constituency,\" and I tend to doubt that the mere prospect of switching over\\n to private practice after serving on the Board would cause them to feel,\\n much less succumb to, pressure to tilt their decisions in a particular direc-\\n tion in the interests of securing future employment as a union or manage-\\n ment-side lawyer.54\\n 52.

Careerists who have spent substantial stretches at a NLRB regional field office,\\n where unfair labor practice cases are investigated and tried and election cases are handled,\\n should be particularly well-schooled in the practical difficulties of administering the Act.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n The above analysis, of course, appears to be yet another illustration of\\n the general principle that life is a trade-off. Management and union-side\\n lawyers bring a phenomenal understanding of real-world labor relations to\\n the Board, but are also likely to be extremely biased in their decision-\\n making, whereas careerists are likely to bring a considerable degree of ob-\\n jectivity, but will lack hands-on experience in some important areas. There\\n is another department, however, in which both careerists and private prac-\\n titioners are likely to be found wanting - that of intellectual independence\\n and creativity.\\n As products of the agency, careerists are likely to be too steeped in \"the\\n system\" to be creative thinkers about the NLRA; years of applying long-\\n standing Board precedent as a Regional Director, for instance, would not\\n seem to particularly encourage one to spend a great deal of time question-\\n ing the fundamental assumptions underlying that precedent.7       Nor can\\n management or union-side advocates be counted upon, as a general matter,\\n to generate new and creative ways of looking at the statute. They will be\\n interested in a new approach, of course, only to the extent that it favors\\n their side. Given the Board\\'s history of policy oscillation,58 they are, I\\n think, more likely to be found taking the path of least resistance and simply\\n recycling some past Board\\'s view of a particular issue (or favoring the\\n status quo, depending on the current state of the law) rather than develop-\\n ing an entirely new way of looking at the problem.\\n Members Kennedy, Penello, and Johansen were all long-time regional employees and for-\\n mer Regional Directors. See GROSS, BROKEN PROMISE, supra note 29, at 221-22, 386 n. 176.\\n As for the three other NLRB careerists to serve, John Higgins had spent several years at the\\n Board\\'s Memphis regional office before going to Washington headquarters, John Truesdale\\n began his career as a Board \"field examiner\" or investigator, and John Miller had served as\\n an NLRB Administrative Law Judge, hearing unfair labor practice cases at the regional\\n level. See id. at 381-82 n.64; Clinton Names Truesdale NLRB Chairman, supra note 31;\\n White House Selects Higgins, supra note 3 I. Among the four government careerists from\\n legislative or \"other-agency\" backgrounds, only Robert Hunter had regional office experi-\\n ence; Hunter had spent the first five years of his career as an NLRB field attorney. See\\n CONGRESSIONAL QUARTERLY, supra note 34, at 379.\\n 57. 1 am certainly not suggesting that Board Regional Directors are incapable of or\\n uninterested in thinking for themselves about Board policy; I simply do not think that their\\n job - with its heavy emphasis on \"case processing\" (i.e., the speedy and accurate applica-\\n tion of existing Board law to the multitude of cases filed in any regional office every month)\\n and its many managerial challenges - encourages it.\\n 58.

Enter Professor Gould\\n Viewed against this backdrop, Professor Gould appeared to be the per-\\n fect NLRB nominee. As a professor of labor law, he combined the objec-\\n tivity of the careerist with the intellectual independence of the academic.\\n As an arbitrator, he brought some of the added practical expertise of the\\n union or management-side lawyer, along with a willingness, as a neutral, to\\n actually put that expertise into effect.\\n Academics, like careerists, will of course have opinions on many labor\\n issues, but will not be locked into either the union or management view of\\n disputed issues; that is, like careerists, they should be ready and willing to\\n weigh the arguments on both sides before making important policy judg-\\n ments. They should excel, moreover, when it comes to intellectual inde-\\n pendence and creativity; academics, after all, are expected \"to test and pro-\\n pose revisions in the prevailing wisdom ..... to reexamine (\\'re-search\\')\\n what may currently be thought sound but may be more or less unsound.59\\n Arbitrators, moreover, like union and management-side lawyers, have\\n considerable exposure to the day-to-day problems of labor relations and is-\\n sues of contract administration 60 (if not negotiation) as well as, of course, a\\n thorough knowledge of the grievance/arbitration process. While an arbi-\\n trator\\'s experience with these issues is one step removed from that of union\\n and management representatives, an arbitrator - unlike a partisan repre-\\n sentative - will presumably be willing to draw on that experience to the\\n fullest as opposed to using it only to bolster arguments on one side.\\n Professor Gould, moreover, was not just any academic/arbitrator. Dur-\\n ing his twenty-five years in academia, almost all of it at Stanford,6\\' Gould\\n 59. William W. Van Alstyne, Academic Freedom and the First Amendment in the Su-\\n preme Court of the United States: An Unhurried Historical Review, 53 LAW & CONTEMP.\\n PROBs. 79, 87 (1990). See, e.g., Clyde W.

REv. 791 (1998) (questioning, by another prominent pro-\\n fessor of labor law, of fundamental premises in five major areas of labor law).\\n 60. Arbitrators deal with two broad categories of cases: disciplinary cases requiring a\\n determination of whether there was \"just cause\" for the discipline imposed, and non-\\n disciplinary cases requiring an interpretation of contractual language that affects the bar-\\n gaining unit more broadly (e.g., a management rights or subcontracting clause). See Gould\\n Hearings, supra note 5, at 13 (citing Bureau of National Affairs publication giving this\\n breakdown); Demand for Labor Arbitrators Unchanging, Officials Tell ABA Gathering,\\n 1999 Daily Lab. Rep. (BNA) No. 28, at A-7 (Feb. 11, 1999) (describing breakdown of Fed-\\n eral Mediation and Conciliation Service arbitration cases on this basis). The disciplinary\\n cases certainly provide a window into day-to-day labor relations, as do the broader interpre-\\n tive cases into issues of contract administration.\\n 61. See FEDERAL YELLOW BOOK, supra note 4, at 111-176 (noting that Gould taught at\\n Stanford Law School from 1972-93). Prior to moving to Stanford, Gould had taught at\\n Wayne State Law School for three years and as a Visiting Professor at Harvard Law School\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n had written six books and over sixty articles on labor and employment is-\\n sues.62 He had become a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators\\n at the age of 33 -   one of the youngest ever admitted,63 and had been se-\\n lected to serve on the much-vaunted \"Dunlop Commission\" on the future of\\n labor-management relations before his appointment to the Board.64\\n On top of his impressive career as a neutral, Gould also had experience\\n on both sides of the bargaining table;65 before entering academia, he had\\n worked for the United Auto Workers and for a management-side law firm\\n as well as for the NLRB66 -    an absolutely unprecedented range of experi-\\n ence67 for a Labor Board nominee.68 Indeed, Gould had even represented\\n for one year.

See FEDERAL YELLOW BOOK, supra note 4, at 111-176 (reporting that Gould was\\n Assistant General Counsel for United Auto Workers from 1961-62, an attorney with NLRB\\n from 1963-65, and an associate with Battle, Fowler, Stokes & Kheel from 1965-68); see\\n also Gould Hearings, supra note 5, at I (opening statement of Sen.

As noted supra note 28, before her appointment Betty Murphy had worked for a\\n law firm that represented international unions as well as management clients. To my\\n knowledge, however, no Board member other than Gould has worked first on the union side\\n and then for management - or vice versa - prior to appointment.\\n 68. This range of experience was widely touted by Gould\\'s supporters. See, e.g.,\\n Gould Hearings, supra note 5, at I (opening statement of Sen.

[and] that he will\\n go down in history as a truly evenhanded, highly intelligent, profound\\n thinker, and . . . a truly great Chairman of the National Labor Relations\\n Board.73\\n II. THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING\\n How, then, did Professor Gould pan out in practice? Here the record is\\n decidedly mixed. If one looks only at Gould\\'s decisional record, his term\\n was in many ways impressive, and 1he promise of his balanced and varied\\n background largely borne out. As soon as one ventures beyond the four\\n corners of Gould\\'s published opinions, however, the lustre of his tenure is\\n tarnished considerably. Indeed, in the realm of politics, Professor Gould\\'s\\n chairmanship of the NLRB must be deemed little short of disastrous.\\n 69. That is, the Act grants employees the right to self-organization and to bargain col-\\n lectively through representatives of their choosing (as well as the right to refrain from such\\n activities); it confers no rights on either employers or unions.

The Decisional Record\\n On the decisional front, Gould\\'s background turned out to be a strong\\n predictor of performance. In particular, his record reflected a high degree\\n of objectivity and intellectual independence, whether measured qualita-\\n tively or quantitatively.\\n As a quantitative matter, Gould\\'s votes in disputed cases were consid-\\n erably less predictable than those of his colleagues from management or\\n union-side practice. In cases in which at least one Board member dis-\\n sented, ex-management lawyer Peter Hurtgen compiled a \"perfect\" 61-0\\n pro-management record during Gould\\'s tenure74 and ex-union attorney\\n Margaret Browning was not far behind with a 97-2 pro-union record,75\\n while former management lawyers J. Robert Brame and Charles Cohen\\n compiled 27-2 and 86-12 pro-management records, respectively.76 Gould\\'s\\n votes in disputed cases, in contrast, broke down in a much less lopsided\\n fashion: 159 for the \"union\" position and 46 for the \"management\" posi-\\n tion, or seventy-eight versus twenty-two percent.77\\n A qualitative assessment of Gould\\'s record also makes clear that he was\\n very much his own man while at the Board. On the one hand, Gould took a\\n number of positions that can be classified as solidly \"pro-union:,78 for in-\\n 74. See Nixon Peabody LLP - Publications, Personnel Law: A Sharply-Divided NLRB\\n Faces the Future With a New Chairman (Jan. 1999)  (tracking Hurtgen\\'s voting record up through August 1998, when Chairman Gould\\'s\\n term expired).\\n 75.

See supra note 89; see also Commu-\\n nications Workers of Am. v. Beck, 487 U.S. 735 (1988). Beck created a whole host of is-\\n sues to be resolved (at least in the first instance) by the Board, such as whether and by what\\n means the union must inform employees of their Beck rights, what type of contractual union\\n security language is permissible following Beck, which expenses count as \"representa-\\n tional,\" whether the union may use an in-house as opposed to independent auditor to verify\\n its breakdown of expenses, and what fora exist for an employee who wishes to challenge the\\n breakdown of expenses, to name just a few.

See Reich Predicts Senate Will Remove Riders,\\n supra note 133 (describing rider); see also Bill Would Harm NLRB, Gould Says, supra note\\n 133. The rider was ultimately dropped from the final budget package. See Labor Board\\n Slated for 3 Percent Cut, supra note 145.\\n The executive order on permanent replacements had come under immediate attack\\n from both Congressional Republicans and the business community.

Chairman Gould\\'s pub-\\n lic endorsement of the order came a few weeks after the Senate Appropriations Committee,\\n faced with \"a full court press on the issue\" from \"a united business front,\" attached a rider to\\n the Labor Department spending bill (which also covers the NLRB) prohibiting the depart-\\n ment from enforcing the order. See Striker Replacements: Ban On Striker Replacement Or-\\n der Attached to Labor, HHS Spending Bill, 1995 Daily Lab. Rep.

The controversy over this rider held up the Senate bill for\\n some time, and was resolved only when a federal court of appeals, in a suit brought by sev-\\n eral employer organizations, held that the executive order was preempted by the NLRA, un-\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n Midway through his term, Gould acknowledged that his outspokenness\\n had been criticized,\\'57 but responded with defiance. \"I will not be muzzled\\n by any quarter as I carry out my duties as NLRB Chairman,\" Gould pro-\\n claimed.    He vowed to \"\\'continue to do the job that I set out to do, which\\n includes making the kinds of speeches about law reform that antagonize\\n members of Congress.\"\\'159\\n der which the hiring of permanent replacements is considered lawful. See New Leadership\\n Elected at AFL-CIO, supra note 145, at C4 (reporting that as of January 11, 1996, Senate\\n bill remains stalled due to dispute over inclusion of language barring implementation of or-\\n der on striker replacements); Chamber of Commerce v.

See Reich Predicts Senate Will Remove Riders, supra note 133.\\n In addition, another of the highly controversial issues that Gould insisted on speaking\\n out on during the budget fight, the Board\\'s single-facility rulemaking proceeding, became\\n the subject of an appropriations rider not long after Gould\\'s public comments. See supra\\n note 152. That rider was actually included in the final budget package and took effect. See\\n Labor Board Slated for 3 Percent Cut, supra note 145.\\n 157.

Id. at 14.\\n 159. See Rosenblum, supra note 94, at 36. In defending his outspokenness, Gould in-\\n voked \"precedent,\" noting that some past Board chairs and General Counsels had made pro-\\n posals for amending the statute. See Gould, Employee Participation, supra note 128, at 13\\n (noting that Chair Harry Millis had advised President Roosevelt on need for amending\\n Wagner Act, and that during the \"difficult days of Taft-Hartley transition,\" Chairman Paul\\n Herzog had expressed his views on labor law reform to both President Truman and Con-\\n gress); see also Letter by Gould to Republican Members of Committee, supra note 121, at E-\\n 2 (noting that Herzog and General Counsel Robert Denham made proposals regarding leg-\\n islation to Congress in late 1940s).\\n In fact, in modem times such public comment on legislative issues by Board mem-\\n bers appears to be the exception rather than the rule. See Miller, The Gould NLRB, supra\\n note 94, at 8 (\"[S]ome of [Gould\\'s] speeches were quite shocking to me because, during my\\n term as chairman and for many years both before and after my term, board members were\\n careful to avoid public expressions of opinion with respect to labor legislation.\"); Cohen\\n Testimony, supra note 46, at E-3:\\n As a Member of the National Labor Relations Board, I adhered to the tradition of re-\\n fusing to comment on the wisdom of proposed legislation.

Gould\\'s accusations that his colleagues were sitting on\\n cases, for instance, provided yet another round of anti-NLRB ammunition\\n both to a Republican Congress that was already unhappy with the Board\\n and to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, one of the\\n agency\\'s most aggressive enemies.236 Indeed, Gould\\'s thinly-veiled attacks\\n on Member Sarah Fox237 and his letter to Congress identifying Fox as the\\n pending cases out the door is instructive. Whereas Gould made up his own list of cases that\\n he believed urgently needed deciding and simply presented that list to his colleagues, Trues-\\n dale involved his colleagues from the beginning, securing their support for the project early\\n on and then involving them in the identification of cases that needed attention and the de-\\n velopment of a plan for getting those cases issued. Compare Alexander, supra note 18, at\\n 14 (reporting that Gould presented list of 26 cases to his colleagues, and now complains that\\n 23 of the 26 are still undecided), with Truesdale Reflects on Tenure, supra note 233 at A- 10\\n (quoting Truesdale\\'s statement that other board members \"\\'enthusiastically embraced\"\\' no-\\n tion of working together to reduce backlog of old cases and \"worked with him to develop a\\n plan for accomplishing that goal\").\\n In a tweak at Gould, in discussing the Board\\'s success in getting 125 of its 146 oldest\\n and most difficult cases out during the first year of his chairmanship, Truesdale stressed the\\n importance of \"maintaining collegiality\" and \"avoiding political entanglements\" - the pre-\\n cise areas in which Gould so clearly fell short - to the achievement of that goal. See id.\\n (\"\\'[lI]n my experience, one of the primary keys to getting cases out the door, particularly the\\n difficult cases, is the ability of board members to work together;\\' another important factor\\n is avoiding political entanglements, because \"\\'those few exceptions\"\\' in which the Board or\\n its chair have become caught up in debate about various legislative proposals illustrate that\\n \"\\'the costs of doing so are simply too high in terms of the risks to the board\\'s independence\\n and the diversion of time and resources from the board\\'s statutory mission of deciding\\n cases. \"\\').\\n 236. Many of the 23 cases that Gould publicly rebuked his colleagues for not issuing,\\n see supra note 229, involved so-called \"Beck\" or union security issues. See Alexander, su-\\n pra note 18, at 14; see also supra notes 89-90, 129 (discussing Beck and issues spawned by\\n decision). The National Right to Work Committee and its Legal Defense Foundation are\\n extremely aggressive in their monitoring of and lobbying regarding Beck issues. See supra\\n note 131; see also Reed Larson, Union Bosses Lose a Friend at the NLRB, WALL ST. J., July\\n 9, 1998, at A18 (quoting Foundation\\'s president as asserting that Gould \"leaves behind a\\n legacy of lawlessness\" at Board, and that \"[u]nder his reign, the NLRB has often flouted\\n judicial mandates in trying to keep workers from enforcing their [Beck] rights\").\\n 237. See Skrzycki, Stacks and Stones, supra note 226, at G-2 (noting that it is clear to\\n those who practice before Board that Gould\\'s public complaints about one member holding\\n up cases pertain to Fox); see also Alexander, supra note 18, at 1, 14 (noting that although\\n Gould declines to discuss individual board members by name, as examples of egregious de-\\n lay he points to two cases on which Fox is known to be the outstanding vote; \"sources fa-\\n miliar with NLRB\" say Fox is main target of Gould\\'s complaints, though fellow democrat\\n Wilma Liebman is stalling on cases as well). See, e.g., Gould, Law and Politics, supra note\\n 168, at 9 (complaining once again about \"refusal of [one Member] to act on important mat-\\n ters\"); Skrzycki, Stacks and Stones, supra note 226, at G-2 (reporting that it was clear that\\n such references are to Fox). After his term was up, Gould was apparently willing to explic-\\n itly name names. See A Rigged Game, WALL ST.

Thus, in addition to creating both internal and ex-\\n ternal problems for the Board during his tenure, Gould\\'s lack of collegiality\\n potentially set the agency up for continued difficulties following his de-\\n parture.

See supra note 227 and accompanying text (indicating that Gould sent internal\\n \"one-member\" sheets identifying Fox as member with most outstanding cases to Congress\\n along with letter hinting that Fox is reluctant to vote on controversial issues while nomina-\\n tion to full term is pending). In addition to his letter to Congress, Gould also sandbagged\\n Fox in a letter to the Foundation itself. See Alexander, supra note 18, at 15 (responding to\\n petition filed with D.C. Circuit by National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation asking\\n court to compel Board to issue decision in a Beck case, Gould writes letter to Foundation\\n stating that case was being held up by a particular member\\'s inaction); id. at 14-15 (noting\\n that it is clear that reference is to Fox); see also supra note 237.\\n 239. See Larson, supra note 236 (citing the internal \"one-member\" sheets submitted by\\n Gould to Congress, Foundation\\'s president states that Fox \"has single-handedly blocked the\\n issuance of at least a dozen Beck cases ....\"); see also Alexander, supra note 18, at 14\\n (quoting Foundation\\'s spokesperson as stating that Gould\\'s comments regarding Fox\\'s\\n stalling on Beck cases will \"have the effect of damaging [Fox\\'s] ability to be ... made\\n chairman, because of her horrible record in workers\\' rights with regard to compulsory un-\\n ionism); id. (noting that Gould\\'s \"parting shots\" are \"provid[ing] ammunition for outside\\n critics - some of whom are already seeking to stir political opposition to Fox\").\\n At least until Gould began his attacks on Fox, she was perceived as his probable suc-\\n cessor. See id. at 1, 14 (describing Fox as \"the likely candidate to succeed Gould as chair-\\n man\" and noting that Fox is \"viewed by many as Gould\\'s presumptive heir\"); Aaron Bern-\\n stein, How Business Is Winning its War with the NLRB, Bus. WK., Oct. 1997, at 59 (stating\\n that Fox will likely replace Gould as chair when his term expires). Contrary to those earlier\\n expectations, President Clinton did not designate Fox Board chair when Gould\\'s term ex-\\n pired. See Clinton Names Truesdale NLRB Chairman, supra note 31 (reporting President\\'s\\n naming of former Board Member John Truesdale to open seat and designation of Truesdale\\n as Board chair).\\n 240. See Larson, supra note 236 (stating that \"Gould is gone but his fellow opponents of\\n Beck remain on the NLRB,\" and citing the one-member sheets submitted to Gould by Con-\\n gress showing that Fox is member responsible for failure of many Beck cases to issue). The\\n Wall Street Journal made much the same use of Gould\\'s allegations. See A Rigged Game,\\n supra note 237. In an editorial claiming that the \"NLRB Jacobins\" had \"rigged the work-\\n place in favor of organized labor,\" the Journal reported that Gould had accused Fox of\\n stonewalling on Beck cases, that Fox had denied the allegations, and that unnamed Gould\\n critics claimed that Gould was the one holding up the Beck cases. Id. The Journal then con-\\n cluded: \"We\\'ll leave them to fight it out. The point is that individual workers aren\\'t getting\\n a fair or speedy hearing within NLRB portals.\" Id.\\n \\n  \\n THE GOULD YEARS AT THE NLRB\\n \\n as Board chair, Truesdale made every effort to put as much distance be-\\n tween Gould and himself as possible.241\\n Gould\\'s conception of the Board\\'s internal workings, like his conception\\n of the Board\\'s relationship to Congress, reflected a real naivete. For in-\\n stance, Gould appeared surprised that his colleagues were not more defer-\\n ential to him as Board chair,242 and that they would oppose procedural\\n changes (such as measures meant to expedite the issuance of cases) that to\\n 241. Truesdale began his first speech after assuming the Board chairmanship as follows:\\n [Ilf I have a \"secret agenda\" as Chairman, it is simply to get the cases out. That, after\\n all, is the primary function of the Board. I have always viewed the Board as kind of\\n an administrative court, with the Board Members being like \"judges,\" and having a\\n professional rather than a political mission. . . . With few exceptions, the Board has\\n historically resisted or shied away from becoming involved in the political process by\\n commenting on legislation, and for good reason in my view.... [lI]t seems to me that\\n once the Board starts getting involved in the legislative process its status [as] an inde-\\n pendent decider of labor disputes would very soon be lost altogether. During my ten-\\n ure as Chairman you can be sure that I will not be looking for opportunities to com-\\n ment on legislation or making policy pronouncements on what the law should be,\\n rather than what it is.\\n Industrial Relations Research Association 51st Annual Meeting, Labor and Employment\\n Law Section Roundtable, NLRB Press Release, R 2317 (Jan. 4, 1999) (emphasis added).

Gould was asking his colleagues to voluntarily reduce their\\n own power - and hence their ability to serve their constituencies - and in\\n some instances to inflict harm on or at least reduce some strategic advan-\\n tage possessed by \"their\" side as well.246 The real surprise here, then, is\\n less his colleagues\\' reaction than Gould\\'s own lack of comprehension.\\n 243.

It has long been rec-\\n ognized that recess appointees awaiting confirmation are under consider-\\n able pressure - and may well react by proceeding cautiously,249 and stall-\\n ing near the end of another Board member\\'s term is not an unheard-of\\n technique.250 As former Board chair Guy Farmer once put it, the Board is a\\n FOR LABOR LAW REFORM, in RESTORING THE PROMISE OF AMERICAN LABOR LAW 75, 78\\n (Sheldon Friedman, et al., eds., 1994) (finding that union win rate declined significantly\\n when election was held over six months after filing of petition as compared to within two\\n months of petition\\'s filing; delay gives employer more time in which to campaign aggres-\\n sively against union).

Lack of Collegiality\\n Academia, Gould\\'s former Board colleague Dennis Devaney once sug-\\n gested, is simply not conducive to fostering the sort of internal collegiality\\n in which Gould was so lacking. An academic, Devaney noted,253 functions\\n as a \"lone wolf.\"254 At the Board, in contrast, as Devaney bluntly put it,\\n \"you need to get three votes.\"1255\\n There is certainly a superficial appeal to the notion that Gould\\'s clashes\\n with his colleagues were more or less predictable given his academic line-\\n age. Academia, after all, is one of the last bastions of autonomy in today\\'s\\n workplace; academics for the most part both teach and write alone, and\\n have no need to secure their peers\\' cooperation except when it comes to\\n faculty politics. This theory rather quickly wilts, however, under further\\n examination.\\n First, the academics who have served on the Labor Board,256 far from\\n fitting a uniform profile, have been a decidedly mixed bag in terms of col-\\n departure; one lawyer comments \"[li]t\\'s no surprise to me that the other members are hold-\\n ing up decisions until Gould leaves. It\\'s happened on a number of occasions in the past.\").\\n 25 1. See GROSS, BROKEN PROMISE, supra note 29, at 97.\\n 252. See infra text accompanying notes 253-55, 283.\\n 253. Ironically, perhaps, Devaney himself is now an academic; he teaches labor law at\\n Wayne State University, the very school at which Gould got his start. See supra notes 54,\\n 61.\\n 254. See Devaney Cites Philosophical Split, supra note 45 (quoting Devaney\\'s remarks,\\n upon his departure from the Board, that \"the ability to build relationships and coalitions is\\n difficult for someone whose background is in academia,\" and that \"[at the Board] you need\\n to get three votes,\" whereas a tenured professor \"is more like a lone wolf\\').\\n 255. Id. Whereas more routine Board cases are decided by a three-member panel, cases\\n presenting important policy -issues are generally decided by the full five-member Board.\\n 256. While many Labor Board members have served as adjunct professors and a few\\n have spent a year or two teaching full-time at some point prior to their Board service, there\\n have been only a handful of \"true\" academics (i.e., individuals who have spent the bulk of\\n \\n [52:2\\n \\n  \\n 2000]               THE GOULD YEARS AT THE NLRB                           529\\n legiality. William Leiserson, a former economics professor who served in\\n the late 1930s and early 1940s,257 indeed had notably bad relations with\\n some of his fellow Board members and other Board personnel.258 Leiser-\\n son contemporaries and fellow academics Warren Madden and Harry Mil-\\n lis, however,259 were perfectly collegial so far as it appears;2  indeed, Mil\\n lis was characterized as a \"peacemaker.\"261\\n Second, professional background as a general matter simply does not\\n appear to be a very reliable predictor of collegiality. The profoundly un-\\n collegial Leiserson, for instance, arguably should have been the ultimate\\n good colleague; Leiserson was a well-known mediator262 -         a job that is\\n their careers in academia) appointed to the Board. In addition to Gould, they are: Warren\\n Madden (1935-40), William Leiserson (1939-43) and Harry Millis (1940-45), all discussed\\n infra in text. Moreover, the pre-Board career of Howard Jenkins, who served from 1963-83,\\n was split roughly equally between academia and government service. See Howard Jenkins,\\n Jr., to be a Member of the National Labor Relations Board: Hearings Before the Senate\\n Comm. on Labor and Public Welfare, 88th Cong. 6-7 (1963) (indicating that Jenkins held\\n governmental positions from 1942-46, taught labor and administrative law at Howard Uni-\\n versity Law School from 1946-56, and served in Department of Labor from 1956 until ap-\\n pointment to Board in 1963); FIRST SIXTY YEARS, supra note 29, at 56 (listing Jenkins as\\n serving on Board from 1963-83).\\n 257.

Dotson presided over a Board \"deep in internal feuding\" and\\n \"wrecked . . . by poor morale,\"265 due in part to Dotson\\'s ideological\\n agenda,266 but also to his \"abrasive and combative style and authoritarian\\n behavior.\"267 Dotson\\'s incendiary management style appeared to have little\\n to do with his background, however; Dotson was no \"lone wolf,\\'268 but\\n rather a former corporate labor counsel269 -     a position, once again, that\\n would seem to require fairly good management or interpersonal skills.\\n as it appears. See GRoss, MAKING OF THE NLRB, supra note 206, at 75.

See id. at 118.\\n 264. See GROSS, RESHAPING OF THE NLRB, supra note 199, at 90. Indeed, Leiserson\\n had to be pressured to leave the National Mediation Board (NMB) for the NLRB by Presi-\\n dent Roosevelt; he considered himself a mediator rather than an adjudicator, and wanted to\\n stay at the NMB so that he could use his mediation skills. Id.; EISNER, supra note 257, at\\n 18. In 1943 he returned to the NMB as its chair. See EISNER, supra note 257, at 90; see also\\n GROSS, RESHAPING OF THE NLRB, supra note 199, at 245. Millis had been a member of, but\\n not the chair of, the pre-Wagner Act NLRB, a body created by executive order in 1934. See\\n GROSS, MAKING OF THE NLRB, supra note 206, at 72, 74-75.\\n 265. GROSS, BROKEN PROMISE, supra note 29, at 253.\\n 266. See infra notes 279-82 and accompanying text. For example, Dotson attempted to\\n strip Carter-appointed General Counsel William Lubbers of the responsibility for conduct-\\n ing the Board\\'s enforcement litigation, and to instead place thai responsibility with Reagan-\\n appointed Solicitor Hugh Reilly, a former staff attorney with the National Right to Work\\n Legal Defense Fund. See GROSS, BROKEN PROMISE, supra note 29, at 25 1. As for Dotson\\'s\\n inability to get along with the other Board members, in the course of the ensuing Congres-\\n sional hearings, Dotson testified in explaining his actions that other Board members had\\n complained to him that the General Counsel sometimes misrepresented the Board\\'s position\\n to the courts, only to have that testimony contradicted by Members Jenkins, Zimmerman\\n and Hunter.

It is further a product, I believe, of what\\n might be called an appointee\\'s internal reward system. The rewards for\\n public executives such as agency heads, political scientist James Q. Wilson\\n has noted, are largely intangible: \"egoistic or ideological considerations\\n such as popularity, a reputation for power, or identification with a\\n cause.\"270 Moreover, due to their short tenure in office, Wilson observed,\\n many of these executives\\' rewards come from outside the agency - from\\n their reputation among their allies in the regulated community, their stand-\\n ing with the president, or their image in the press, for instance.27\\'\\n This reward system identified by Wilson goes a long way, I believe, to-\\n ward explaining otherwise inexplicably uncollegial (and even unprofes-\\n sional) conduct on the part of agency members. Gould\\'s end-of-the-term\\n potshots at his colleagues for \"stalling\" on cases, for instance, \"made\\n sense\" if Gould was more concerned with his reputation in the academic\\n community -    to which he was about to return -  than with the Board\\'s\\n future ability to function. Gould presumably perceived his reputation\\n within that community as resting primarily on the mark he made on Board\\n policy rather than on his non-decisional performance, and was willing to\\n risk creating future problems for his colleagues and the agency in the inter-\\n ests of forcing \"reputation-enhancing\" decisions out the door before his\\n term expired. Indeed, Gould\\'s statements at the time regarding his concern\\n for his \"legacy\" lend support to such a theory.272 While this may seem to\\n be a skewed set of priorities for an agency head, \"maintaining the executive\\n is not,\" as Wilson noted, \"the same as maintaining the organization.273\\n The striking lack of collegiality on the part of former Board members\\n Leiserson and Dotson is similarly explicable by reference to their respec-\\n tive reward systems. At the time of Leiserson\\'s nomination, it was widely\\n thought that Communists had infiltrated the NLRB, and Leiserson was ap-\\n pointed with instructions to \"get rid of them\"274 and to \"clean up the mess\\n 270. WILSON, supra note 25, at 197.\\n 271. Seeid.at209.\\n 272. See Alexander, supra note 18, at 15 (\"I am very concerned about my legacy.... I\\n don\\'t want [my] contribution to be suppressed by a board member that sits on cases for\\n years.\"); Greenhouse, Parting Shots, supra note 3 (containing similar quotation).\\n 273. WILSON, supra note 25, at 197 (emphasis in original). In terms of maintaining the\\n executive, see Rosenblum, supra note 94, at 83 (quoting former Board chair Ed Miller as\\n stating that Gould has a \"very large, sensitive ego\"). See, e.g., Greenhouse, Parting Shots,\\n supra note 3 (reporting Gould\\'s complaints regarding other Board members\\' tailure to act\\n on cases and statement that, \"[I]\\'m concerned because of my legacy. Indolence and indeci-\\n sion are being used to thwart the issuance of leading cases, which include my policy ideas.\")\\n 274. See GROSS, RESHAPING OF THE NLRB, supra note 199, at 91 (recounting Leiser-\\n son\\'s instructions from FDR).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n at the NLRB.\"\\' When Leiserson warned the Roosevelt administration\\n that this \"house-cleaning\" mandate276 would result in \"the most terrific\\n clash of me and the other Board members ever heard in this town,\"277 he\\n was told to do whatever needed to be done278 _ and he set about his task\\n with zeal. Leiserson\\'s lack of collegiality, then, appears directly attribut-\\n able to the much higher value he placed on serving the president than on\\n \"getting along\" - two values which in this instance were incompatible if\\n not mutually exclusive.\\n Dotson, for his part, was a highly ideological appointee279 -  a \"crusader\\n for the Reagan cause.\"280 He presumably cared little about irritating his\\n colleagues or other Board personnel because his mission was to advance\\n Ronald Reagan\\'s agenda -     which he was able to do quite successfully.28\\'\\n That is, Dotson, like Leiserson, was primarily interested in maintaining his\\n standing with the president (and his ideological cohorts), not with his fel-\\n low Board members or the labor bar more generally - and he acted ac-\\n cordingly.282\\n 275. Id. (quoting instructions from FDR\\'s secretary).\\n 276. See id. at 90.\\n 277. Id.\\n 278. Id. at 91.

Thus, for example, Dotson presumably did not care about the furor that resulted\\n from his attempt to unilaterally transfer oversight responsibility for the Board\\'s enforcement\\n litigation from the General Counsel to the Solicitor because the transfer would have ad-\\n vanced the Reagan political agenda; Reagan-appointed Solicitor Hugh Reilly was consid-\\n ered a right-wing radical and would certainly have taken much more conservative positions\\n than the liberal, Carter-appointed General Counsel William Lubbers. See discussion supra\\n note 266. Compare Penn Kemble, The New Anti-Union Crusade, THE NEW REPUBLIC, Sept.\\n 1983, at 18, 19 (describing Reilly as an \"anti-union crusader,\" and reporting that during stint\\n under Dotson at Department of Labor, Reilly had been \"moonlighting as unpaid chief coun-\\n sel in a major anti-union lawsuit ... filed and financed by the National Right to Work Legal\\n Defense Foundation.\"), with Moe, supra note 279, at 264 (stating that Lubbers was known\\n as a \"liberal Democrat[] highly sympathetic to unions\").\\n With Dotson, at least, however, there was also a personality element at play.

PoliticalNaivete\\n Turning now to Gould\\'s near-genius for irritating Congress, the case for\\n attributing Gould\\'s problems in this area to his academic background ap-\\n pears initially at least to be a strong one. First, as Gould\\'s fellow law pro-\\n fessor Michael Gottesman has observed, academics are to some degree pro-\\n fessional provocateurs:\\n [G]ood academics are gadflies. A significant part of their business is to write, speak,\\n and think provocatively. . . . Political discourse, by contrast, is concerned with ar-\\n riving at consensus ... In the political context, [one\\'s] success hinges on being ac-\\n ceptable to the members of both parties, who often espouse quite opposite values. To\\n speak too provocatively on a controversial subject is likely to alienate [those] on at\\n least one side of the aisle.283\\n In his propensity to speak out on pending legislation and other \"hot button\"\\n issues, Gould, of course, seemed to fit Gottesman\\'s \"gadfly\\'284 label to a\\n Second, Gould seemed earnestly to believe that Congress could be won\\n over based on reason and the force of ideas281 -   an \"ivory tower\" notion if\\n there ever was one. Moreover, Gould\\'s persistence in this notion at least\\n until well into his term286 presents an uncanny parallel to the career of fel-\\n low academic Warren Madden,287 the first NLRB chair.28 The politically\\n nying text.

In addition to the sources cited supra notes 294-99 and accompanying text, com-\\n pare Gould\\'s actions in the Detroit Newspapers case with those of Feinstein. As discussed\\n above, in Detroit Newspapers Gould took the unprecedented step of issuing a written opin-\\n \\n [52:2\\n \\n  \\n THE GOULD YEARS AT THE NLRB\\n \\n The above evidence notwithstanding, it would be overly simplistic to\\n conclude that academics invariably make bad politicians - or legislative\\n aides good ones, for that matter. As with collegiality, the correlation be-\\n tween professional background and external political skill turns out to be\\n highly questionable.\\n First, while Professors Gould and Madden were naifs, there have been\\n other Board chairs and members from academia who were considered quite\\n politically astute. Most notable among these was University of Chicago\\n economist Harry Millis, who was named to replace the politically naive\\n Madden precisely because of his pragmatism.30\\' Indeed Millis, a \"quiet\\n man who disliked publicity and public appearances .... [and] believed that\\n \\'enforcing a law should never become a crusade,\"\\'302 might be thought of\\n as the antithesis of Gould. Whereas Gould\\'s outspokenness only \"fueled\\n ion in favor of authorizing the General Counsel to seek 10(j) relief and publishing that\\n opinion in a labor law journal, and later issued a press release criticizing the District Court\\n for denying injunctive relief and suggesting that the judge lacked a proper understanding of\\n both the law and the facts. See supra text accompanying notes 175-79. In contrast, Fein-\\n stein did not highlight his decision to pursue injunctive relief in the case, and when that re-\\n lief was denied merely expressed regret that the District Court did not believe injunctive re-\\n lief was warranted and stated that \"[w]e continue to believe that we have a strong case for\\n injunctive relief [and] [w]e are carefully reviewing the Judge\\'s opinion and expect to decide\\n soon whether to appeal the district court\\'s decision.\" Statement of NLRB General Counsel\\n Fred Feinstein on Detroit News Case, NLRB Press Release, R 2246 (Aug. 14, 1997). Not\\n surprisingly, Gould\\'s highly public actions quickly drew criticism from the management\\n community. See 1997 House Oversight Hearings, supra note 14, at 76 (statement of Roger\\n King for Society for Human Resource Management) (\"[T]hrough these unprecedented and\\n gratuitous comments, opinions, and observations, Chairman Gould has revealed his own\\n strong personal views, formulated before deciding the merits of the exceptions and cross-\\n exceptions filed by the [newspapers] in connection with the [ALJ\\'s] decision.\"). Moreover,\\n at least one Gould critic contrasted Gould\\'s sharp criticism of the District Court\\'s decision\\n with Feinstein\\'s much more measured response. See id. at 77-78 n.7 (citing as evidence of\\n appearance of bias on Gould\\'s part that the \"quasi-judicial officer of the agency (the Chair-\\n man) issue[d] a more anti-respondent statement than ... the prosecutor (the General Coun-\\n sel).\").\\n 301. See GROSS, RESHAPING OF THE NLRB, supra note 199, at 226-29. Millis and his\\n fellow academic-turned-Board Member William Leiserson were both known for pursuing\\n \"realistic industrial relations [which] in great part meant adapting [the Board] to the politi-\\n cal, economic and labor relations realities of the time .... to reduce the pressure being ap-\\n plied on the Board by Congress, by the AFL, and by business and industry.\"\\' Id. at 242;\\n supra text accompanying note 257. Of Howard Jenkins, whose pre-Board career was split\\n equally between government and academia, it can at a minimum be said that he was suffi-\\n ciently unobjectionable politically to be reappointed by three different presidents (Johnson,\\n Nixon and Carter) following his original appointment by President Kennedy. See also Ruth\\n Simon, NLRB Member Calls it a Day, NAT\\'L L.J., Sept. 5, 1983, at 6; see also supra note\\n 256.\\n 302.

But the decisions would have been better reasoned\\n and more tolerant. Employers who are really anti-union might not have liked the Act\\n or the Board any better, but they would have had less ammunition for their attacks.3\"\\'\\n And just as there have been politically savvy Board members from aca-\\n demia, there have been extremely impolitic members from \"political\"\\n backgrounds. In fact, such is the case with the most notorious \"impolitic\"\\n in Board history, Member Edwin Smith, whose \"\\'intemperate, radical,\\n public utterances\"\\' brought a hail of criticism down on the NLRB.a°6\\n The most persuasive evidence that Gould\\'s lack of political skills were\\n not purely or even primarily a product of his academic background comes\\n not from the NLRB archives, however, but from the relatively recent his-\\n tory of another agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). More spe-\\n cifically, Gould\\'s tenure resembled nothing so much as the embattled reign\\n of Michael Pertschuk as head of the FTC from 1977-81. Pertschuk, how-\\n ever, came to his post not from academia, but direct from fifteen years on\\n Capitol Hill.307\\n Like Gould, Pertschuk was unquestionably a true expert in his field,308\\n and took office at a seemingly propitious time for his agency, when the re-\\n cent election of a Democratic president gave the Democrats control of both\\n 303.

As to the latter, Pertschuk\\n later conceded that \"my own unfortunate tendency to untamed rhetoric in\\n speeches and interviews\" contributed to \"an unflattering portrait ... of an\\n agency and its arrogant chairman, heedless and contemptuous of Con-\\n gress.322 Indeed, he ruefully concluded: \"I had the good sense not to make\\n 319.

The first, it would seem, is tempera-\\n ment; some people simply find it easier - or try harder - to be diplomatic\\n and to refrain from lashing out than others. The second, I believe, is the\\n nominee\\'s internal reward system. As discussed earlier,326 James Q.

The most im-\\n portant distinction is between legislative rules and interpretative rules. In\\n most circumstances, an agency can issue a legislative rule only by using the\\n notice and comment procedure described in APA Section 553.2 By con-\\n trast, an agency can issue an interpretative rule at any time without using\\n the notice and comment procedure.3 For over fifty years, courts and com-\\n mentators have struggled to identify, and to apply, criteria that are appro-\\n priate to distinguish between legislative rules and interpretative rules. The\\n results have not been pretty. Courts often refer to the distinction between\\n the two types of rules as \"fuzzy,\"4 \"tenuous,\"5 \"blurred,\\'\\'6 \"baffling,\"7 and\\n * Lyle T.

Circuit\\n does an excellent job of identifying all of the criteria that are important in\\n distinguishing between legislative rules and interpretative rules.\" Thus,\\n the courts need only apply the criteria set forth in that opinion to reduce\\n significantly the rampant confusion and inconsistency that characterize this\\n important area of law. For a few years, it seemed likely that the D.C. Cir-\\n cuit\\'s 1993 opinion would have that socially beneficial effect. It was\\n praised by authors of casebooks,2 hornbooks,3 and treatises,14 and fol-\\n lowed both within the circuit5 and by six other circuits.16 Then, in 1997,\\n the D.C. Circuit abandoned the criteria it had adopted in 1993 in favor of a\\n new and inconsistent set of criteria.17 I argue that the courts can improve\\n the quality, clarity, and consistency of decisionmaking in this area simply\\n 5.

In Part IV, I critique the 1997 opinion and\\n argue in support of a return to the criteria announced in 1993.\\n I. EFFECTS OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LEGISLATIVE RULES AND\\n INTERPRETATIVE RULES\\n The APA actually does not refer to anything called a \"legislative rule.\"\\n Rather, it refers to \"rules,\"\\'18 requires that rules be issued through \"rule-\\n makings,\"\\'19 describes the procedures applicable to \"rulemaking,\"20 and then\\n exempts several types of \"rules,\" including \"interpretative rules,\"2\\' from\\n the procedures for rulemaking. Courts and commentators often refer to\\n rules that are subject to the rulemaking procedure as \"legislative rules\" be-\\n cause they have the same effects as statutes.22\\n One of the most important distinctions between legislative rules and in-\\n terpretative rules is procedural. Unless another exemption applies, a valid\\n legislative rule can be adopted only through use of the APA rulemaking\\n procedure.23 If an agency attempts to issue a legislative rule without fol-\\n lowing that procedure, the result is sometimes called a \"spurious rule.,24 It\\n can have no effect of any type. By contrast, an agency can issue an inter-\\n pretative rule without following any procedure.\\n The APA prescribes a three-step rulemaking procedure.25 The agency\\n must issue a notice of proposed rulemaking in which it describes the rule it\\n is proposing to issue. The agency then must solicit, receive, and consider\\n 18. 5 U.S.C. § 551(4) (1994).\\n 19. Id. § 551(5).\\n 20. 5 U.S.C. § 553 (1994).\\n 21. Id. § 553(b)(A).\\n 22.

See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b).\\n 24. See Robert A. Anthony, \"Interpretive \" Rules, \"Legislative \" Rules, and \"Spurious\"\\n Rules: Lifting the Smog, 8 ADMIN. L.J.

Fi-\\n nally, it must issue the final rule, incorporating a statement of the rule\\'s ba-\\n sis and purpose.\\n The APA rulemaking procedure has many advantages.26 It enhances the\\n quality of rules by allowing the agency to obtain a better understanding of a\\n proposed rule\\'s potential effects in various circumstances and by allowing\\n the agency to consider alternative rules that might be more effective in\\n furthering the agency\\'s goals or that might have fewer unintended adverse\\n effects. Second, it enhances fairness by providing all potentially affected\\n members of the public an opportunity to participate in the process of shap-\\n ing the rules that will govern their conduct or protect their interests. Fi-\\n nally, it enhances political accountability by providing the President and\\n members of Congress a better opportunity to influence the rules that agen-\\n cies issue.\\n The advantages of the rulemaking process come at a high price, how-\\n ever. The courts have adopted expansive interpretations of the elements of\\n the rulemaking process that have had the effect of making it long and\\n costly.27 In order to minimize the risk that a court will reject the rule as\\n \"arbitrary and capricious,\" the agency must include in the statement of ba-\\n sis and purpose a detailed explanation of its reasons for adopting the rule, a\\n detailed explanation for its rejection of comments that criticize the rule in\\n various respects, and a detailed explanation for its rejection of alternative\\n rules proposed in comments.28 In the context of a controversial rule that is\\n premised on complicated and uncertain relationships and debatable value\\n judgments, the resulting decisionmaking process is long and arduous.29\\n The process through which EPA issued new ozone and particulate stan-\\n dards in 1997 is illustrative.30 EPA proposed to increase the stringency of\\n the pre-existing standards in 1992 .3 EPA interpreted the one hundred-plus\\n studies that had been published since it issued the prior standards as indi-\\n cating a high likelihood that the pre-existing standards were not adequately\\n protecting public health.32 Many of those studies found adverse health ef-\\n fects, including deaths, as a result of exposure to ozone and particulates in\\n 26.

By the time\\n EPA issued the final rules, it had devoted several thousand pages to the\\n process of explaining why it chose one set of standards rather than myriad\\n alternative sets of standards urged in the comments it received.35\\n The APA rulemaking procedure often requires many years and tens of\\n thousands of person hours to complete.36 The resulting costs to society ap-\\n pear in many forms.37 A rule often is not issued for years after the agency\\n perceives a need for the rule. A rule often remains in effect unamended for\\n years after it has been rendered obsolete by changes in technology or by\\n changes in our understanding of the relationships on which the rule was\\n premised. An agency that is required by statute to issue a large number of\\n rules often can comply with only a small fraction of its statutory mandates\\n because it lacks the resources necessary to conduct all the rulemakings\\n Congress has ordered it to conduct. Finally, in many circumstances, an\\n agency finds the rulemaking process so arduous that it chooses not to issue\\n rules at all. It attempts instead to carry out its statutory mission solely\\n through ad hoc adjudication of disputes.\\n Given the high costs of the rulemaking process, it should come as no\\n surprise that agencies often attempt to avoid it by issuing interpretative\\n rules. There are several serious limits on an agency\\'s ability to rely on in-\\n terpretative rules to accomplish its mission, however. First, many agency-\\n administered statutes are drafted in ways that render issuance of a legisla-\\n tive rule an indispensable predicate to the agency\\'s ability to use any other\\n mechanism to implement the statute. Thus, for instance, the Clean Air Act\\n authorizes EPA and other institutions to take a variety of actions to enforce\\n ambient air standards, but the Act itself does not establish any such stan-\\n dards.38 As a result, neither EPA nor any other institution can take any ac-\\n tion to reduce concentrations of a pollutant until EPA has used the rule-\\n making process to issue a legislative rule that prescribes the maximum\\n permissible concentration of that pollutant. In the absence of such a legis-\\n 33. See Richard J. Pierce, Jr., The Inherent Limits on Judicial Control of Agency Dis-\\n cretion: The D.C. Circuit and the Nondelegation Doctrine, 52 ADMIN. L.

An\\n interpretative rule must interpret something - either a statute or a legisla-\\n tive rule.\\n Second, even when an agency has a choice between issuing a legislative\\n rule or an interpretative rule, it often chooses to issue a legislative rule be-\\n cause a legislative rule has much more powerful effects than an interpreta-\\n tive rule. Thus, for instance, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\\n prohibits discrimination against disabled people, and it does not require the\\n agency to issue legislative rules that define \"discrimination\" or \"disabil-\\n ity.\"39 The agency could use either legislative rules or interpretative rules\\n to particularize statutory terms like \"discrimination\" and \"disability.\"\\n The two types of rules have different effects, however. As the Supreme\\n Court has said consistently since at least 1920, a legislative rule has the\\n \"force and effect of law if it be not in conflict with express statutory provi-\\n sion.\\'4° A legislative rule binds the public and courts in a manner indistin-\\n guishable from a statute.41 By contrast, an interpretative rule is only a\\n statement of the agency\\'s present interpretation of the statute. In its famous\\n opinion in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., the Supreme Court made it clear that\\n an interpretative rule has no \"power to control.\"2 It is instead an expres-\\n sion of the agency\\'s judgment that a court might, or might not, find persua-\\n sive, depending on \"the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the va-\\n lidity  of  its  reasoning, its  consistency  with  earlier and  later\\n pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if\\n lacking power to control.\"3 As the Court has recognized, interpretative\\n rules have value primarily as a means of communicating to the agency\\'s\\n staff and affected members of the public the agency\\'s current views with\\n respect to the proper interpretation of its statutes and legislative rules.4\\n In recent years, however, this traditional distinction between the effects\\n of legislative and interpretative rules has diminished in some circuits. In\\n 1984, the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Chevron US.A.,\\n Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.45 The Court held that a re-\\n viewing court must uphold any reasonable agency interpretation of an am-\\n biguous agency-administered statute.6 It is clear that the powerful form of\\n deference described in Chevron applies to agency interpretations of statutes\\n 39. 42 U.S.C. § 12112 (1994).\\n 40.

Thus, for instance, the Department of\\n Health and Human Services (HHS) has issued 640 pages of legislative rules\\n that describe the basic features of the complicated program it administers to\\n reimburse providers of medical services that are covered by Medicare.52 It\\n is impossible, however, for any agency to rely entirely on legislative rules\\n to resolve definitively all potential controversies that may arise in the fu-\\n ture. Any set of legislative rules will contain ambiguities and internal con-\\n flicts that the agency cannot anticipate and resolve when it issues the rules.\\n HHS has supplemented its legislative rules with thousands of pages of in-\\n terpretative rules that address myriad details that are not explicitly resolved\\n by the legislative rules.\\n This common agency approach to the choice between legislative and in-\\n terpretative rules is eminently practical. When it addresses a core issue, the\\n agency uses the procedurally superior, but slow and expensive, rulemaking\\n 47. See DAVIS & PIERCE, supra note 22, § 3.5.\\n 48. Robert A. Anthony, Which Agency Interpretations Should Bind Citizens and\\n Courts?, 7 YALE J. ON REG. 1 (1990). Anthony\\'s starting point is the principle that an\\n agency has only the power Congress has delegated to it. He then argues that upholding a\\n rule through application of Chevron deference has the effect of giving that rule the power to\\n bind courts and the public. He argues that Congress gave agencies the power to issue rules\\n with binding legal effects only through use of the notice and comment procedure applicable\\n to legislative rules.\\n 49.

When it\\n comes to details of implementation, the agency opts for the faster and more\\n flexible option of issuing interpretative rules. The agency knows that its\\n interpretative rules are much more vulnerable to judicial rejection in an en-\\n forcement proceeding, and that it is more likely to err when it issues a rule\\n without going through the notice and comment procedure. The agency also\\n knows, however, that it can correct its errors quickly if its experience with\\n an interpretative rule persuades it that the rule was a mistake.\\n II. THE D.C. CIRCUIT\\'S 1993 OPINION\\n After decades of less than successful judicial efforts to distinguish be-\\n tween legislative rules and interpretative rules, the D.C. Circuit took a fresh\\n approach to the task in its 1993 opinion in American Mining Congress v.\\n Mine Safety & Health Administration.53 The Mine Safety and Health Act\\n requires every mine operator to \"make such reports ... as the Secretary [of\\n Labor] . . . may reasonably require ....,4 The Mine Safety and Health\\n Administration (MSHA) issued legislative rules that required mine opera-\\n tors to report \"each... occupational illness\" that occurs at a mine.\" Those\\n rules required a mine operator to report any case of pneumoconiosis as\\n soon as it was \"diagnosed.56 After a few years, MSHA discovered that\\n mine operators were applying widely varying criteria in deciding when to\\n report a lung disease as having been \"diagnosed\" as pneumoconiosis.\\n MSHA addressed this problem by issuing an interpretative rule that par-\\n ticularized the criteria for diagnosis of pneumoconiosis. The interpretative\\n rule defined \"diagnosed\" with reference to an internationally-recognized\\n twelve-step system of classifying chest x-rays. Thus, an x-ray with a rating\\n of 1/0 or higher would qualify as diagnosis of pneumoconiosis.57 The\\n American Mining Congress (AMC) argued that the x-ray diagnosis rule\\n actually was a legislative rule that was procedurally invalid because MSHA\\n had issued it without using the notice and comment procedure.\\n In a carefully-reasoned opinion authored by a distinguished administra-\\n tive law scholar,58 the D.C. Circuit rejected AMC\\'s argument and held that\\n 53. 995 F.2d 1106 (D.C. Cir. 1993).\\n 54. 30 U.S.C. § 813(h) (1994).\\n 55.

Judge Stephen Williams taught administrative law at the University of Colorado for\\n many years and wrote extensively in the field until he was appointed to the D.C. Circuit.\\n See, e.g., Stephen F. Williams, Liberty and Property: The Problem of Government Benefits,\\n 12 J. LEG. STuD. 3 (1983).\\n \\n [52:2\\n \\n  \\n LEGISLATIVE AND INTERPRETATIVE RULES\\n \\n the rule was a valid interpretative rule.59 The court began by noting the\\n extreme confusion that had characterized the process of distinguishing be-\\n tween legislative and interpretative rules.60 In light of that confusion, the\\n court decided to start with first principles. It quoted the definitions of leg-\\n islative and interpretative rules in the 1947 Attorney General\\'s Manual on\\n the APA.61 The Supreme Court has relied on the definitions in the Attor-\\n ney General\\'s Manual in many cases.62 The Manual defined legislative, or\\n substantive, rules as \"rules [that] have the force and effect of law.\\'63 It de-\\n fined interpretative rules as \"rules... issued .. . to advise the public of the\\n agency\\'s construction of the statutes and rules which it administers.\\'64\\n The court then used a combination of reasoning based on the definitions\\n in the Manual and reasoning based on judicial decisions to explain the dis-\\n tinction drawn in the Manual.65 Since a rule is legislative only if it has \"the\\n force of law,\" a rule is legislative only if Congress has given the agency the\\n power to issue a rule that has \"the force of law,\" and the agency intended to\\n exercise that power.66 Thus, the critical question for a court is whether the\\n agency intended to issue a rule with \"the force of law.\" If the agency says\\n that it is issuing a rule with the force of law, a court can simply take the\\n agency at its word.67 The agency has no incentive to falsify its intention in\\n that situation. The resulting rule is then valid only if Congress gave the\\n agency the power to issue such rules, and if the agency used the notice and\\n comment procedure to issue the rule.\\n If the agency says instead that it is issuing only an interpretative rule,\\n however, it is not appropriate for a court simply to accept the agency\\'s\\n 69\\n characterization.  In such a situation, the agency has an incentive to\\n mischaracterize a legislative rule as interpretative to circumvent the APA\\n rulemaking procedure. Thus, a court must attempt to determine whether a\\n putative interpretative rule is actually a procedurally invalid legislative rule\\n by determining whether the rule, if valid, actually has \"the force of law.\"\\n 59.

American Mining Congress, 995 F.2d at 1112.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n The court then began to identify circumstances in which a rule, if valid,\\n necessarily has \"the force of law.\"\\n First, the court concluded that a rule that is essential to support an en-\\n forcement action necessarily has \"the force of law.\"69 For instance,\\n MSHA\\'s rules that require a mine operator to report occupational illnesses,\\n including pneumoconiosis, once they have been diagnosed, must be legis-\\n lative rules.7° In the absence of those rules, a mine operator would have no\\n duty to report any occupational disease, and MSHA would have no basis to\\n bring an enforcement action against a mine operator for failure to report a\\n case of pneumoconiosis. Thus, those rules clearly have \"the force of law.\"\\n The court concluded that the x-ray diagnosis rule does not have the force of\\n law in that respect, however.71 Even without that rule, MSHA would have\\n a basis for bringing an enforcement action against a mine operator for fail-\\n ing to report a case in which a chest x-ray scored a 1/0 or higher on the in-\\n ternationally used scale for diagnosing pneumoconiosis. The pre-existing\\n legislative rule that required a mine operator to report any diagnosed case\\n of pneumoconiosis would be enough to support such an enforcement ac-\\n tion. That rule created a duty to report a diagnosed case of pneumoconio-\\n sis. The chest x-ray rule simply clarified the circumstances in which that\\n duty is triggered.\\n Second, the court concluded that an agency intends to issue a rule with\\n the force of law when it publishes the rule in the Code of Federal Regula-\\n tions (CFR).72 The court based this conclusion on a statute that authorizes\\n publication of a rule in CFR only if the rule has \"general applicability and\\n legal effect.73\\n Third, an agency rule is legislative if the agency explicitly states that it is\\n exercising its legislative authority.74 If the agency intends to apply the rule\\n in a manner that has the force of law, the agency must use the procedures\\n specified for issuance of such a rule. The court noted that courts react dif-\\n ferently to agency attempts to apply legislative rules and interpretative\\n rules in subsequent proceedings.\" A court must give a legislative rule the\\n force of law unless the rule is inconsistent with a statute. It is appropriate\\n to give a legislative rule that powerful effect because it has been issued\\n through the notice and comment process. Thus, the party against which the\\n rule is being applied had ample opportunity to challenge the basis for the\\n 69.  Id. at 1109.\\n 70.  See id. at 1109.\\n 71.

Id. at II11.\\n \\n [52:2\\n \\n  \\n LEGISLATIVE AND INTERPRETATIVE RULES\\n \\n rule, and the agency has already been required to defend the basis for the\\n rule in a reviewing court. By contrast, when an agency attempts to rely on\\n an interpretative rule in a subsequent proceeding, a court will consider ar-\\n guments that the rule is not reasonable, sensible, or justified in the en-\\n forcement proceeding.\\n Thus, a rule cannot escape the filter of judicial review regarding the ade-\\n quacy of the agency\\'s reasons in support of the rule. In the case of a legis-\\n lative rule, the agency must be prepared to defend the adequacy of its rea-\\n soning process in a proceeding to review the rule.76 In the case of an\\n interpretative rule, the agency must be prepared to defend the adequacy of\\n its reasoning process in support of the rule in each case in which it attempts\\n to apply the rule.\"\\n Fourth, a rule must have the force of law if it is inconsistent with a prior\\n legislative rule.78 Since the prior legislative rule has the force of law, it can\\n only be amended by another rule that has the force of law. Thus, any rule\\n that amends a legislative rule necessarily is a legislative rule.\\n In explaining this criterion, the court made two important distinctions.\\n First, a rule that merely clarifies or particularizes a prior legislative rule\\n need not be a legislative rule.79 An agency need not be exercising legisla-\\n tive authority when it interprets a legislative rule by resolving an ambiguity\\n in the rule. Second, a rule that is inconsistent with a prior interpretative\\n rule need not be a legislative rule. The court explained that important prin-\\n ciple in two ways. Using formal legal reasoning, the court noted that an\\n interpretative rule does not have the force of law.80 It follows logically that\\n an agency need not issue a rule that has the force of law to amend or revoke\\n an interpretative rule. Using policy-based reasoning, the court noted that\\n requiring agencies to use notice and comment rulemaking to amend an in-\\n terpretative rule would discourage agencies from issuing interpretative\\n rules at all.8\\' Agencies would be reluctant to issue interpretative rules for\\n fear that they would be required to live with the consequences of a mis-\\n taken interpretation of a rule or statute during the years required to use the\\n notice and comment procedure to correct their mistakes. That would have\\n serious adverse effects on members of the public affected by agency-\\n administered statutes and rules. In the absence of interpretative rules,\\n members of the public would be forced to guess with respect to agency in-\\n terpretations of the many ambiguous provisions of agency-administered\\n 76. See id.\\n 77. See id\\n 78. See id. at 1109.\\n 79.  See id. at 1112.\\n 80. American Mining Congress, 995 F.2d at 1111-12.\\n 81.  Id.\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n statutes and legislative rules. The court concluded that any legal doctrine\\n that discourages agencies from issuing interpretative rules would adversely\\n affect the public by reducing significantly the public\\'s ability to know the\\n agency\\'s interpretations of statutes and legislative rules.82\\n The court then summarized its criteria for distinguishing between legis-\\n lative and interpretative rules in a single paragraph:\\n Accordingly, insofar as our cases can be reconciled at all, we think it almost exclu-\\n sively on the basis of whether the purported interpretive rule has \"legal effect\", which\\n in turn is best ascertained by asking (1) whether in the absence of the rule there would\\n not be an adequate legislative basis for enforcement action or other agency action to\\n confer benefits or ensure the performance of duties, (2) whether the agency has pub-\\n lished the rule in the Code of Federal Regulations, (3) whether the agency has explic-\\n itly invoked its general legislative authority, or (4) whether the rule effectively\\n amends a prior legislative rule. If the answer to any of these questions is affirmative,\\n we have a legislative, not an interpretive rule.3\\n Since the x-ray diagnosis rule did not meet any of the criteria for char-\\n acterization as a legislative rule, the court held that it was a valid interpre-\\n tative rule.\"\\n In another part of its opinion, the court referred to another important\\n criterion that was not at issue in the case.5 Sometimes an agency issues\\n legislative rules that are extremely vague and open-ended. The legislative\\n rules resolve few, if any, major issues. The agency then uses interpretative\\n rules to make all of the important decisions and to provide real content to\\n the amorphous legislative rules. The court illustrated this impermissible\\n practice by referring to one of the D.C. Circuit\\'s prior opinions,s6 United\\n States v. Piccotto.87 In Piccotto, the Park Service issued a legislative rule\\n in which it specified certain conditions that would apply to a class of per-\\n mits it issues. The rule also stated that a permit can \"contain additional\\n reasonable conditions.88 The agency then issued an interpretative rule in\\n which it purported to add a specific mandatory \"reasonable condition\" to\\n the list of specific conditions contained in the legislative rule.89 The court\\n held that the agency could not \"interpret\" the open-ended phrase \"addi-\\n 82.

The APA\\n rulemaking process is designed to enable an agency to use a carefully de-\\n vised procedure to convert vague statutory standards into a reasonably clear\\n set of rules. If courts give effect to agency interpretations of amorphous or\\n open-ended legislative rules, they will allow agencies to substitute regula-\\n tory ambiguity for statutory ambiguity, thereby making a \"mockery of...\\n the APA.\"92\\n This criterion is sometimes difficult to apply. Its application requires a\\n court to distinguish among degrees of ambiguity. It is impossible to draft\\n legislative rules that are free of all potential ambiguities and internal incon-\\n sistencies. Yet, an agency should not be allowed to draft its legislative\\n rules in such a broad manner that they are susceptible to an extraordinarily\\n wide range of interpretations. Two Supreme Court decisions issued in\\n 1994 and 1995 illustrate the potential difficulty of this judicial line-drawing\\n process.93 In each case, five Justices upheld an interpretative rule on the\\n basis that the agency had gone as far as reasonably could be expected of it\\n in resolving major issues through the legislative rulemaking process, even\\n though its legislative rules contained important ambiguities that the agency\\n resolved through issuance of interpretative rules.94 The four dissenting\\n Justices expressed the view that the legislative rules the agency purported\\n to interpret were too vague to support the much more detailed interpretative\\n rules. The difficulty of applying this criterion in close cases is not a suffi-\\n cient reason to reject the criterion, however. Courts should continue to re-\\n ject agency attempts to use the combination of vague or open-ended legis-\\n lative rules and detailed interpretative rules to circumvent the APA\\n rulemaking procedure, as the American Mining Congress Court recognized.\\n 90.

Shalala,\" the author of the\\n American Mining Congress opinion wrote an opinion in which he stated\\n that publication of a rule in CFR is no more than \"a snippet of evidence of\\n agency intent.\"96 The court had two good reasons to eliminate that crite-\\n rion.97 First, an interpretative rule can be eligible for publication as a rule\\n that has \"legal effect\" even though the rule does not have \"the force of\\n law.\" A rule can have a variety of \"legal effects.\" All interpretative rules\\n have at least one important \"legal effect.\" They provide potentially af-\\n fected members of the public notice of the agency\\'s interpretation of its\\n statute or legislative rules. Thus, interpretative rules are eligible for publi-\\n cation in CFR. Second, many agencies follow the practice of publishing\\n their most important interpretative rules in CFR. That practice is socially\\n beneficial because it allows affected members of the public superior access\\n to the agency\\'s most important rules, whether they are legislative or inter-\\n pretative. The court was appropriately concerned that its prior suggestion\\n that publication of a rule in CFR would be enough alone to characterize a\\n rule as legislative would discourage agencies from continuing to publish\\n particularly important interpretative rules in CFR.\\n As amended to reflect the addition of the fifth criterion recognized in\\n dicta, and to delete the CFR publication criterion, the American Mining\\n Congress Court\\'s list of criteria for use in distinguishing between legisla-\\n tive rules and interpretative rules would then read:\\n (1) whether in the absence of the rule there would not be an adequate legislative basis\\n for enforcement action or other agency action to confer benefits or ensure the per-\\n formance of duties;\\n (2) whether the legislative rule the agency is claiming to interpret is too vague or\\n open-ended to support the interpretative rule;\\n (3) whether the agency has explicitly invoked its general legislative authority; or\\n (4) whether the rule effectively amends a prior legislative rule. If the answer to any\\n of these questions is affirmative, we have a legislative, not an interpretative, rule.98\\n The four criteria announced in American Mining Congress are a marked\\n improvement on the bewildering array of confusing and inconsistent meth-\\n ods of distinguishing between legislative and interpretative rules that courts\\n had used in the past. Moreover, the American Mining Congress Court pro-\\n 95. 23 F.3d 412 (D.C. Cir. 1994).\\n 96. Id. at 423.\\n 97. Id.\\n 98.

Not\\n surprisingly, the American Mining Congress opinion was widely praised in\\n casebooks, treatises, and hornbooks.99 It was also followed both within the\\n circuit and by other circuits.00 It appeared that the legal regime applicable\\n to the distinction between legislative and interpretative rules had undergone\\n a major, socially-beneficial transformation -  until the D.C. Circuit aban-\\n doned the American Mining Congress test in 1997.\\n III. THE D.C. CIRCUIT\\'S 1997 OPINION\\n In its 1997 opinion, Paralyzed Veterans ofAmerica v. D.C. Arena,\\'10 the\\n D.C. Circuit changed one criterion in the American Mining Congress test.\\n The American Mining Congress Court held that a rule is a legislative rule if\\n it \"effectively amends a prior legislative rule.\"\\'02 The Paralyzed Veterans\\n Court stated that a rule is a legislative rule if it amends a prior agency in-\\n terpretation of a legislative rule, i.e., an interpretative rule.\\'03 The Ameri-\\n can Mining Congress Court had rejected that proposition.104 The resulting\\n change in doctrine has enormous practical effects. Before Paralyzed Vet-\\n erans, agencies routinely changed their interpretations of legislative rules\\n through issuance of interpretative rules. After Paralyzed Veterans, agen-\\n cies can change such interpretations only by using the notice and comment\\n procedure to issue a legislative rule.\\n The facts of Paralyzed Veterans made it an unusual vehicle for an-\\n nouncing this major change in doctrine. The Department of Justice (DOJ)\\n had adopted as its own a legislative rule originally issued by the Architec-\\n tural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Board) to implement\\n Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).105 The rule pro-\\n vided that owners of sports arenas had to provide disabled individuals in\\n wheelchairs a choice of \"admissions prices and lines of sight comparable to\\n those for members of the general public.\"\\'16 Several years later, DOJ is-\\n sued an interpretative rule in which it interpreted \"lines of sight compara-\\n 99.

Arena argued that the inter-\\n pretative rule was invalid on several grounds. The court first held that\\n \"lines of sight comparable\" is easily read to require seating with a view\\n over standing spectators.08 It then characterized as the D.C. Arena\\'s \"most\\n powerful argument\" its contention that DOJ had changed its interpretation\\n of the legislative rule.\\'09 The court rejected DOJ\\'s argument that an agency\\n is free to change an interpretation of a legislative rule by issuing an inter-\\n pretative rule.\\' 0 The court went on to uphold the interpretative rule, how-\\n ever, based on its conclusion that DOJ had not adopted a prior inconsistent\\n interpretation of the legislative rule.\"\\' Thus, the major change in doctrine\\n announced in Paralyzed Veterans was dicta.\\n Paralyzed Veterans was a strange case to use to announce this change in\\n doctrine for another reason as well. The court could easily have rejected\\n the interpretative rule at issue on either of two grounds that are entirely\\n consistent with the criteria announced in American Mining Congress.\\n When the Board issued the legislative rule that DOJ adopted, the Board\\n stated clearly that the rule did not address at all the issue of lines of sight\\n over standing spectators.112 The Board stated its intent to address that issue\\n in a future rulemaking proceeding.\"3 Thus, the court could have held the\\n interpretative rule invalid as an attempt to amend a legislative rule without\\n using the rulemaking procedure. The Third Circuit used that reasoning to\\n hold the rule invalid.14 The court also could have held that the interpreta-\\n tive rule was invalid as an \"unreasonable\" interpretation of the legislative\\n rule. It was unreasonable for DOJ to adopt an interpretation of the Board\\'s\\n rule that was inconsistent with the Board\\'s characterization of the rule\\n when it was issued, particularly when potentially affected members of the\\n public had good reason to rely on the Board\\'s representation that it would\\n address the standing spectators issue in a subsequent rulemaking.\\n 107.

The Federal Aviation Admini-\\n stration (FAA) has long had a legislative rule that defines as a \"commercial\\n operator\" of a plane any person who carries persons or property by aircraft\\n \"for compensation or hire.\"\"\\' In 1963, FAA interpreted this rule to ex-\\n clude Alaskan hunting and fishing guides who transport their clients by\\n plane.1\"9 The FAA reasoned that the plane transportation so provided is\\n \"merely incidental\" to the pilot\\'s guiding business. As a result of that in-\\n terpretation of the rule, Alaskan hunting and fishing guides who fly clients\\n to destinations were exempted from the requirements that they obtain\\n commercial pilot licenses and abide by the rules applicable to commercial\\n pilots, even though they clearly carry persons \"for compensation or hire.\"\\n FAA personnel in Alaska relied on the FAA\\'s 1963 interpretation as the\\n basis for the advice they gave guides until 1990.2\\' At that time, FAA\\'s\\n Assistant Chief Counsel wrote a letter to the Alaska Regional Office in\\n which he questioned the continued validity of the 1963 interpretation of the\\n rule that exempts all guide-pilots.\\'2\\' Around the same time, FAA also\\n brought an enforcement action against a guide-pilot for failing to comply\\n with the agency rules governing commercial pilots. A FAA Administrative\\n Law Judge (ALJ) refused to impose penalties on the guide-pilot.22\\n 115. See Amax Land Co. v. Quarterman, 181 F.3d 1356 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Alaska Prof\\'l\\n Hunters Ass\\'n v. FAA, 177 F.3d 1030 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Syncor Int\\'l Corp. v. Shalala, 127\\n F.3d 90 (D.C.

Courts rou-\\n tinely hold that an agency cannot penalize a regulatee for failing to comply\\n with an agency rule when the regulatee lacks notice that his conduct vio-\\n lates the rule.123 At the time the FAA attempted to penalize the guide-pilot,\\n it had not announced any change in its 1963 interpretation of the rule, and\\n its Alaskan personnel were continuing to use that interpretation as the basis\\n for advice to guide-pilots that they were exempt from the rules governing\\n commercial pilots.24 Thus, both the 1963 interpretation of the rule and the\\n advice provided by FAA personnel affirmatively misled guide-pilots to be-\\n lieve that they were not commercial operators. In that situation, application\\n of a different interpretation of the rule to penalize guide-pilots would be\\n fundamentally unfair. It would violate due process.125\\n In 1998, the FAA published a \"Notice to Operators\" (Notice) in the Fed-\\n eral Register.126 FAA acknowledged the existence of its 1963 interpreta-\\n tion of its rules and announced that it was rescinding that interpretation.\\n The Notice announced a new interpretation in which any guide who trans-\\n ports clients by plane and who charges a price that includes both guide\\n services and air transport is a \"commercial operator\" because he is carrying\\n persons by aircraft \"for compensation or hire.\"\\'27 The FAA stated that its\\n new interpretation was based on its conclusion that guide-pilots are literally\\n carrying persons for hire and that requiring guide-pilots to conform to the\\n licensing requirements and regulations applicable to commercial pilots\\n would enhance aviation safety.128\\n The Alaska Professional Hunters Association argued that the \"Notice\"\\n was actually an attempt to issue a legislative rule. As such, it was proce-\\n durally invalid because the FAA did not use the notice and comment pro-\\n cedure. The FAA attempted to defend the Notice as a valid interpretative\\n rule. The court simply cited Paralyzed Veterans and held that the Notice\\n 123. See, e.g., United States v.

Seeid.\\n \\n [52:2\\n \\n  \\n LEGISLATIVE AND INTERPRETATIVE RULES\\n \\n was a procedurally invalid legislative rule because an agency cannot\\n change its prior interpretation of a legislative rule by issuing an interpreta-\\n tive rule.129\\n By contrast, the American Mining Congress Court would have applied\\n its four-factor test and would have upheld the FAA\\'s new interpretation of\\n its legislative rule defining commercial operators as a valid interpretative\\n rule. First, the FAA would have had an adequate basis for bringing an en-\\n forcement action against a guide-pilot in the absence of the new interpreta-\\n tion of its legislative rule. The legislative rule defining \"commercial op-\\n erators\" as persons who carry persons by aircraft \"for compensation or\\n hire\" would have been ample for that purpose. The new interpretative rule\\n would play an important but narrow role in such an enforcement action. It\\n would provide a means of satisfying the critical requirement that a regula-\\n tee must have adequate notice that his conduct violates a rule in order to be\\n penalized for violating the rule. That is one of the primary purposes and\\n socially beneficial effects of an interpretative rule - to provide the public\\n notice of the agency\\'s interpretation of its statutes and rules.\\n Second, the American Mining Congress Court would conclude that the\\n legislative rule the agency was interpreting was not too vague or open-\\n ended. The rule defining \"commercial operators\" is ambiguous in its po-\\n tential application to guide-pilots, but it is not so vague or open-ended as to\\n qualify as an attempt to circumvent the APA rulemaking process. Third,\\n the agency did not explicitly invoke its legislative authority; the agency ex-\\n plicitly characterized the Notice as an interpretation of its legislative rule\\n defining commercial operators.\\n Fourth, and most important, the American Mining Congress Court would\\n have concluded that the Notice was a valid interpretative rule because it did\\n not \"effectively amend a prior legislative rule.\" The FAA\\'s new interpre-\\n tation of its legislative rule defining commercial operators was entirely\\n consistent with the language of the legislative rule. The American Mining\\n Congress Court would not have attached dispositive significance to the fact\\n that the new interpretative rule was inconsistent with a prior interpretation.\\n The American Mining Congress Court explained why it rejected the argu-\\n ment that an interpretative rule cannot amend, or rescind, a prior interpre-\\n tative rule. The American Mining Congress Court would have considered\\n the FAA\\'s change in its interpretation of its legislative rule as one of the\\n factors relevant to the reasonableness of the new interpretation, but it\\n would have had little difficulty concluding that FAA had provided reasons\\n sufficient to support its decision to change its prior interpretation.\\n \\n 129. Id. at 1033-35.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n The sequence of agency actions at issue in Alaska Professional Hunters\\n Ass \\'n is typical of the way most agencies behave on a routine basis. The\\n agency first issues a legislative rule. It then interprets that rule in a par-\\n ticular manner, either in an interpretative rule or in the process of adjudi-\\n cating a particular dispute. A few years or decades later, the agency recog-\\n nizes that its original interpretation of the rule was a mistake that is now\\n causing problems. The American Mining Congress opinion allows the\\n agency to correct its error expeditiously by issuing a new interpretative\\n rule. The Paralyzed Veterans opinion forecloses that option and precludes\\n an agency from amending or rescinding an interpretative rule by issuing a\\n new interpretative rule.\\n IV. INTERPRETATIVE RULES CAN AMEND INTERPRETATIVE RULES\\n The D.C. Circuit\\'s decision in Paralyzed Veterans was a mistake. The\\n D.C. Circuit and all other circuits should return to the four-factor American\\n Mining Congress test. The Paralyzed Veterans Court provided no reason-\\n ing in support of its conclusion that an interpretative rule cannot amend a\\n prior interpretative rule. It simply attributed that rule of law to Congress.\\n The court said that \"Congress ... has said . . . specifically ... [that] agen-\\n cies are obliged to engage in notice and comment before formulating regu-\\n lations, which applies as well to \\'repeals\\' or \\'amendments.\"\",130 The court\\n cited three sources to support that assertion: Section 551(5) of the APA,\\n dicta in a 1995 Supreme Court opinion, and two pages of a 1992 D.C. Cir-\\n cuit opinion.\\' 3  None of those sources support the rule of law the Para-\\n lyzed Veterans court attributed to Congress.\\n Before discussing each of these three sources, it should be noted that the\\n court says that Congress \"specifically\" resolved this issue when it enacted\\n the APA in 1946. If that were true, you would certainly expect that many\\n scholars, judges, and Justices would have detected this Congressional deci-\\n sion and applied this rule of law during the fifty-year period between 1946\\n and 1997. It is at least suspicious that the court is able to cite only brief\\n passages in two judicial opinions that it claims recognize this specific Con-\\n gressional command. It is strange that none of the other learned scholars,\\n Justices and judges, including the judges who decided American Mining\\n Congress, noticed this Congressional command over the last half century.\\n Based on circumstantial evidence alone, it seems highly likely that schol-\\n ars, judges, and Justices overlooked this Congressional command because\\n it is not there.\\n 130. Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D.C. Arena, 117 F.3d 579, 586 (D.C. Cir. 1997)\\n (emphasis omitted).\\n 131. Id. at 586.\\n \\n [52:2\\n \\n  \\n LEGISLATIVE AND INTERPRETATIVE RULES\\n \\n The Paralyzed Veterans Court misinterpreted each of the three sources it\\n cited in support of the rule it announced. It also failed to grapple at all with\\n a mountain of precedent that contradicts that rule.\\n The court began appropriately with the language of the APA. Section\\n 551(5) of the APA defines \"rulemaking\" as \"agency process for fonnulat-\\n ing, amending, or repealing a rule.\"\\'3\\' Thus, the court was certainly correct\\n when it asserted that an agency must use the same procedure when it\\n amends or rescinds a rule as it is required to use when it issues a rule. The\\n Supreme Court so held in 1983.33 Section 551(5) says nothing, however,\\n about the procedure an agency must use to issue a rule. That question is\\n addressed in APA section 553.134 That section describes the notice and\\n comment rulemaking procedure. It also has several exemptions, however.\\n One of those exemptions is for interpretative rules.135\\n When one reads sections 551(5) and 553 together, the meaning of the\\n two sections becomes apparent. When an agency issues, amends, or re-\\n peals a legislative rule, it must use the notice and comment procedure.\\n When it issues, amends, or repeals an interpretative rule, it is not required\\n to use the notice and comment procedure. Every court that had addressed\\n the issue, including the American Mining Congress Court, had reached that\\n logical conclusion until the D.C. Circuit issued its decision in Paralyzed\\n Veterans.136\\n 132. 5 U.S.C. § 551(5) (1994).\\n 133. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\\'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42\\n (1983) (concluding that \"an agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated to\\n supply reasoned analysis for change beyond that which may be required when an agency\\n does not act in the first instance\").\\n 134. 5 U.S.C. § 553 (1994) (describing process agency must follow when creating a\\n rule).\\n 135.

See, e.g., Chief Probation Officers of Cal. v. Shalala, 118 F.3d 1327, 1337 (9th Cir.\\n 1997) (rejecting the \"position that notice and comment is required whenever an agency\\n changes its policy\"); Orengo Caraballo v. Reich, 11 F.3d 186, 196 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding\\n that the rule at issue \"did no more than give a reasonable meaning\" to the words of the rele-\\n vant statute and, thus, was interpretative); White v. Shalala, 7 F.3d 296, 304 (2d Cir. 1993)\\n (\"If the rule is an interpretation of a statute rather than an extra-statutory imposition of\\n rights, duties or obligations, it remains interpretive even if the rule embodies the Secretary\\'s\\n changed interpretation of the statute.\"); Metropolitan Sch.

Davila, 969 F.2d 485, 492\\n (7th Cir. 1992) (stipulating \"that an agency\\'s change in its reading of a statute does not nec-\\n essarily make the rule announcing the change legislative\"); Michigan v. Thomas, 805 F.2d\\n 176, 180 (6th Cir. 1986) (finding the revision of the prior definition of the statutory words\\n \"reasonably available control technology\" to be interpretative and not subject to notice and\\n comment).\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LA W REVIEW\\n \\n The Paralyzed Veterans Court also cited dicta from a 1995 Supreme\\n Court opinion to support its idiosyncratic interpretation of the APA. Spe-\\n cifically, the court said that \"the Supreme Court has noted (in dicta) that\\n APA rulemaking is required where an interpretation \\'adopt[s] a new posi-\\n tion inconsistent with... existing regulations.\"\",137 The dicta the Paralyzed\\n Veterans court attributes to the Supreme Court is in the court\\'s opinion, but\\n the Paralyzed Veterans Court misinterpreted that dicta in the process of\\n quoting it out of the context of the opinion. The \"regulations\" to which the\\n court referred in this passage were the two regulations that the Supreme\\n Court discussed at length in Section II of its opinion.38 It is quite clear\\n from that discussion that the two \"regulations\" are legislative rules that the\\n agency issued through use of the notice and comment procedure. Thus,\\n when the court said that an agency must use the notice and comment pro-\\n cedure when it amends a \"regulation,\" it was saying that an agency must\\n use notice and comment rulemaking when it amends a legislative rule.\\n Throughout its opinion, the court distinguished between \"regulations\" -\\n its shorthand synonym for legislative rules - and \"interpretative rules.\"\\n Scores of judicial opinions, including the D.C. Circuit\\'s opinion in Ameri-\\n can Mining Congress and numerous Supreme Court opinions, support the\\n non-controversial proposition that an agency can only amend a legislative\\n rule by issuing another legislative rule.39 At no point in its opinion in\\n Guernsey, or in any other opinion, has the Supreme Court stated that an\\n agency cannot amend an interpretative rule by issuing an interpretative\\n rule.\\n Finally, the Paralyzed Veterans Court added a \"see also\" cite140 to two\\n pages of the D.C. Circuit\\'s 1992 opinion in National Family Planning &\\n Reproductive Health Ass \\'n v. Sullivan.\\'41 Again, the authority cited by the\\n court does not support the rule of law the court announced. Again, the\\n Paralyzed Veterans Court misinterpreted a passage in an opinion by failing\\n 137. Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D.C. Arena, 117 F.3d 579, 586 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\\n 138. See Shalala v.

National Family Planning involved a challenge to\\n the validity of an HHS attempt to issue an interpretative rule that clearly\\n was inconsistent with a prior legislative rule.\\'42 The 1988 legislative rule\\n prohibited anyone whose organization receives Title X family planning\\n funding from discussing with his or her clients the abortion option.143 The\\n Supreme Court upheld the validity of that so-called \"gag rule\" in its con-\\n troversial 1991 decision in Rust v. Sullivan.144 In 1992, HHS issued an in-\\n terpretative rule in which it \"interpreted\" the 1988 rule to allow doctors\\n who work for organizations that receive Title X funding to discuss the\\n abortion option with their patients.145 Not surprisingly, the court held that\\n the interpretative rule was invalid.46 It obviously purported to amend, in-\\n deed to repudiate, the prior legislative rule.147 The National Family Plan-\\n ning Court said nothing that could plausibly be interpreted as prohibiting an\\n agency from issuing an interpretative rule that amends an interpretative\\n rule. Thus, none of the authorities cited by Paralyzed Veterans Court pro-\\n vides any support for that proposition.\\n The unprecedented decision of the Paralyzed Veterans Court may have\\n been influenced by the pre-existing circuit doctrine that requires a court to\\n confer Chevron deference on an interpretative rule.148 The court did not\\n rely on that doctrine to support the revolutionary principle it announced,\\n but other passages in its opinion suggest that the court was troubled by its\\n realization that circuit precedent required it to accord almost as much def-\\n erence to a statutory interpretation announced in an interpretative rule as to\\n such an interpretation announced in a legislative rule.149 It is troubling to\\n give nearly as much force to a rule that is adopted with no procedural safe-\\n guards as to a rule that is adopted only after conducting a notice and com-\\n ment rulemaking. That problem has an easy solution, however. The D.C.\\n Circuit should overrule its precedents that confer Chevron deference on\\n interpretative rules and join the many other circuits that confer Chevron\\n deference only on statutory interpretations announced in legislative rules.50\\n 142.

The court cited the\\n prior circuit opinion in American Mining Congress with apparent approval,\\n and applied some of its reasoning in the process of resolving some of the\\n issues raised in Paralyzed Veterans.5\\' The court apparently did not even\\n recognize, however, that the American Mining Congress opinion held that\\n an agency could amend an interpretative rule by issuing an interpretative\\n rule.\\n To obtain a full understanding of the scope of the holding in American\\n Mining Congress, it is necessary to provide a more expansive description\\n of the facts of the case. MSHA first issued a legislative rule in which it re-\\n quired mine operators to report every case of pneumoconiosis \"diag-\\n nosed.\\'52 MSHA then issued three interpretative rules that interpreted that\\n legislative rule. The first interpretative rule equated \"diagnosed\" with a\\n chest x-ray rated 1/0 or higher on the international scale for evaluating\\n chest x-rays to determine the existence of pneumoconiosis.153 The second\\n interpretative rule repeated most of what was in the first rule, but it added\\n the caveat that a report of a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis should not be\\n equated with an admission of liability for the reported disease.154 The third\\n interpretative rule added an entirely new concept - a system for rating\\n people who read x-rays.55\\n The third rule interpreted \"diagnosed\" to refer only to an x-ray rating of\\n 1/0 or higher made by a \"B\" reader of x-rays. If the x-ray is rated 1/0 or\\n higher by someone who is not a \"B\" reader, and the mine operator is in the\\n process of obtaining a reading from a \"B\" reader, the mine operator need\\n not report the pneumoconiosis as \"diagnosed\" unless and until it receives a\\n rating of 1/0 from a \"B\" reader. The American Mining Process Court held\\n that the third interpretative rule was a valid interpretative rule.156 The third\\n rule clearly amended the first rule by narrowing the circumstances in which\\n a reading of 1/0 or higher requires a report of a \"diagnosed\" case of pneu-\\n moconiosis. Thus, the American Mining Congress Court necessarily held\\n that an interpretative rule can amend a prior interpretative rule. It follows\\n that the Paralyzed Veterans Court did not even have the power to announce\\n the contrary proposition. One panel of the D.C. Circuit does not have the\\n power to overrule a decision of a prior panel.\\n deference).\\n 151. Paralyzed Veterans, 117 F.3d at 587-88.\\n 152. American Mining Congress v.

When MSHA issued its first\\n interpretation of \"diagnosis,\" it expected that mine operators would experi-\\n ence little or no problem determining that an x-ray was rated 1/0 or higher.\\n It discovered, however, that readers with limited skills and/or experience\\n were overrating some x-rays. It responded to that problem by issuing a\\n third interpretative rule that amended the first interpretative rule by refer-\\n ence to the \"B\" reader requirement. The agency should be commended for\\n detecting and correcting the problem quickly.\\n It would be ludicrous to tell MSHA that it cannot correct the problem\\n with the first interpretation without first conducting a notice and comment\\n rulemaking. Giving MSHA, or any other agency, that message would dis-\\n courage it from issuing any interpretative rules and would encourage it to\\n adopt interpretations of its statutes and rules solely through the process of\\n adjudication. That would disserve the interests of both agencies and all\\n members of the public who are affected by agency interpretations of rules\\n and statutes.157 Yet, that is the message the Paralyzed Veterans Court has\\n sent to all agencies.\\n The American Mining Congress Court also used reasoning that supports\\n its conclusion that an interpretative rule can amend a prior interpretative\\n rule. First, since an interpretative rule does not have the force of law, an\\n agency does not have to issue a rule that has the force of law in order to\\n amend a prior interpretative rule.58 Second, requiring an agency to use\\n notice and comment rulemaking when it wants to amend an interpretative\\n rule would discourage agencies from issuing interpretative rules.59 In-\\n stead, agencies would rely exclusively on case-by-case adjudication of spe-\\n cific disputes as the basis for announcing and amending all changes in its\\n interpretations of its statute and legislative rules. The court concluded that\\n the public would be greatly disadvantaged by a judicial decision that has\\n that effect because interpretative rules provide much better public notice of\\n agency interpretations then do interpretations adopted in adjudicatory deci-\\n sions.16\\n The Paralyzed Veterans Court did not attempt to refute in any way the\\n reasoning in the American Mining Congress opinion or in any of the many\\n 157. See DAVIS & PIERCE, supra note 22, § 6.7 (discussing benefits of the rulemaking\\n process as opposed to the creation of rules through adjudication).\\n 158.

The Su-\\n preme Court has never addressed directly the question whether an agency\\n can amend an interpretative rule by issuing an interpretative rule. The\\n Court has reviewed the validity of many interpretative rules, however.\\n When it does so, the Court applies the test it first announced in 1944 in\\n Skidmore v. Swift & Co.\\'62\\n We consider that the... interpretations ... of the Administrator .... while not con-\\n trolling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experi-\\n ence and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for\\n guidance. The weight of such a judgment . . . will depend upon the thoroughness\\n evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier\\n and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give power to persuade, if\\n lacking power to control.63\\n Note that one of the \"factors\" a court must consider in applying the\\n Skidmore test is the interpretative rule\\'s \"consistency with earlier and later\\n pronouncements.\"\\'64\\n A reading of the many cases that apply the Skidmore test explains how\\n courts consider the \"consistency\" factor.165 Consistency is a plus factor for\\n the agency, in the sense that a court is somewhat more likely to uphold an\\n agency interpretation if it is long-standing. Consistency with prior inter-\\n pretations alone is never dispositive, however. Courts reject even long-\\n standing agency interpretations if they conclude that the agency has not\\n provided an adequate explanation for the interpretation or that the inter-\\n pretation seems to be inconsistent with the statute or rule the agency is in-\\n 161.

A court will uphold an agency interpretation that is inconsistent\\n with a prior interpretation if the agency gives reasons for its change in in-\\n terpretation that a court considers adequate.167\\n At this point, it should be apparent that the principle announced by the\\n Paralyzed Veterans Court cannot be reconciled with the test the Supreme\\n Court has long applied to determine whether an interpretative rule is valid.\\n The Paralyzed Veterans Court says that an agency cannot amend an inter-\\n pretative rule by issuing a new interpretative rule. That obviously gives\\n dispositive effect to inconsistency between an interpretative rule and a prior\\n interpretation. The Supreme Court says that such an inconsistency is sim-\\n ply one of several \"factors\" to consider in determining whether an inter-\\n pretative rule is valid. Under the Supreme Court\\'s test, an interpretative\\n rule can be held valid, notwithstanding its inconsistency with a prior inter-\\n pretative rule, if the other factors in the Skidmore test \"give it power to per-\\n suade.\" Those two ways of thinking about the validity of interpretative\\n rules are irreconcilable.\\n CONCLUSION\\n To summarize the situation, the principle announced in Paralyzed Veter-\\n ans has no support in statutes, case law, or reasoning. It is also inconsistent\\n with numerous well-reasoned circuit court opinions, and with the Supreme\\n Court\\'s long-standing test for determining the validity of an interpretative\\n rule. The courts should reject the principle announced in Paralyzed Veter-\\n ans.\\n The courts also should embrace the criteria for distinguishing between\\n legislative and interpretative rules announced by the American Mining\\n Congress court. The opinion in American Mining Congress is an out-\\n standing example of legal scholarship. It is the most comprehensive and\\n best-reasoned explanation of the distinction between legislative and inter-\\n pretative rules that has ever been published - either in a judicial opinion\\n or in a work of scholarship. It provides courts a unique opportunity to\\n 166. See, e.g., Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115 (1994) (holding agency interpretation of\\n a statute granting disability benefits to veterans inconsistent with plain language and conse-\\n quently invalidating agency interpretation).\\n 167. See, e.g., Smiley, 517 U.S. at 735; C.K. v.

Courts should take advantage\\n of that opportunity.\\n AUTHOR\\'S NOTE\\n On May 1, 2000, the Supreme Court decided Christensen v. Harris\\n County.68 The Court held that interpretative rules are not entitled to the\\n strong form of deference that the Court conferred on legislative rules in\\n Chevron.69 Interpretative rules are entitled only to the much weaker form\\n of deference the Court first described in Skidmore.\\'7 Thus, Christensen\\n overruled the D.C.

These multi-member boards and commissions, which are\\n the prototype independent agencies, bring together individuals of diverse\\n views, expertise, and backgrounds to tackle legally difficult, technically\\n complex, and often politically sensitive issues. Many multi-member agen-\\n cies have the full range of regulatory authority, i.e., they can issue regula-\\n tions, take administrative action to enforce their statutes and regulations,\\n and decide cases through administrative adjudication. They oversee either\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n a specific area of the economyl or have substantive responsibilities that cut\\n across industry lines.2 In traditional theory, their stock-in-trade is the ex-\\n pert, apolitical resolution of regulatory issues. They are \"independent\" of\\n the political will exemplified by the executive branch, yet they are also\\n multi-member organizations, a fact that tends toward accommodation of\\n diverse or extreme views through the compromise inherent in the process\\n of collegial decisionmaking.\\n Justice Sutherland conceived of the independent, multi-member com-\\n mission (at least in the 1930s) as follows:\\n The commission is to be non-partisan; and it must, from the very nature of its duties,\\n act with entire impartiality. It is charged with the enforcement of no policy except\\n the policy of the law. Its duties are neither political nor executive, but predominantly\\n quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative. Like the Interstate Commerce Commission, its\\n members are called upon to exercise the trained judgment of a body of experts ap-\\n pointed by law and informed by experience.\\n [It is] a body of experts who shall gain experience by length of service-a body\\n which shall be independent of executive authority, except in its selection, and free to\\n exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance of any other official or any de-\\n partment of the government.3\\n The Brownlow Commission described independent agencies less charitably\\n as a \"headless \\'fourth branch\\' of the Government, a haphazard deposit of\\n irresponsible agencies and uncoordinated powers.\\'4\\n Over the years numerous articles have surveyed the indicia of independ-\\n ence and the place of independent agencies within a separation of powers\\n framework.5 In this article, we review the structure and internal operations\\n I. For example, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates inter-\\n state aspects of the electric power, natural gas, oil pipeline, and hydroelectric industries. See\\n 42 U.S.C. § 7172(a)(1) (1994); see also Energy Policy Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-486, §§\\n 1801-1804, 106 Stat. 3010, 3011-12.\\n 2. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces a variety of federal antitrust and\\n consumer protection statutes. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. §§ 45(a), 46(d), 53(a) (1994).\\n 3. Humphrey\\'s Ex\\'r v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 624, 625-26 (1935) (internal\\n quotation marks and citation omitted) (emphasis omitted).\\n 4. THE PRESIDENT\\'S COMMITTEE ON ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT, REPORT OF THE\\n COMMITTEE WITH STUDIES OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\\n (1937), reprinted in SUBCOMM. ON SEPARATION OF POWERS OF THE SENATE COMM. ON THE\\n JUDICIARY, SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE INDEPENDENT AGENCIES: CASES AND SELECTED\\n READINGS, S. Doc. No. 91-49, at 346 (1969).\\n 5. See, e.g., Symposium: The Independence of Independent Agencies, 1988 DUKE L.J.\\n 215; A Symposium on Administrative Law: The Uneasy Constitutional Status of the Admin-\\n \\n 1113\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n of independent agencies, note several similarities and differences among\\n them, and address various recurring issues affecting them. We further con-\\n sider the future of this regulatory form as we enter the new millennium.\\n We focus on agencies-whether multi-member or not-where at least one\\n individual is appointed by the President to a full-time, fixed-term position\\n with the advice and consent of the Senate and has protection against sum-\\n mary removal by some form of \"for cause\" restriction on the President\\'s\\n authority.6\\n istrative Agencies, 36 Am. U. L. REV. 277 (1987); Thomas 0. Sargentich, The Contempo-\\n rary Debate About Legislative-Executive Separation of Powers, 72 CORNELL L. REV. 430\\n (1987); Geoffrey P. Miller, Independent Agencies, 1986 SuP. CT. REV. 41; Peter L. Strauss,\\n The Place of Agencies in Government: Separation of Powers and the Fourth Branch, 84\\n COLUM. L. REV. 573 (1984).\\n 6. A highly preliminary survey of the structure and workings of independent agencies\\n was published in monograph form by the Administrative Conference of the United States\\n (Conference) in 1991. -The Conference received numerous requests for copies because it\\n contained comparative information that was immediately useful to agency officials and ad-\\n ministrative practitioners. Now that the Conference has been abolished, we receive tele-\\n phone inquiries about these subjects from agency members, staff, and private practice law-\\n yers. So, we have prepared a new survey of 32 independent agencies, including two that sit\\n squarely in the executive branch. In the Appendix, we have attempted to be inclusive but\\n the lack of comprehensive information makes the task difficult. We may have inadvertently\\n omitted some agencies -that qualify under our definition. Some agencies have been deliber-\\n ately omitted. For example, some boards\\' have members appointed by the President and\\n confirmed by the Senate but the statute provides some mechanism for removal other than\\n presidential removal for cause. See, e.g., 22 U.S.C. § 1622 (1994) (providing that members\\n of Foreign Claims Settlement Commission appointed by President and subject to Senate\\n confirmation do not have statutory term and may be removed by Secretary of State). Others\\n have members appointed by the President but not confirmed by the Senate. For instance,\\n members of the United States Commission on Civil Rights are appointed by the President,\\n the President pro tempore of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.\\n See 42 U.S.C. § 1975(b) (1994). Numerous boards and other components within agencies\\n are staffed by career civil servants and empowered to undertake a wide range of agency\\n functions affecting the public. The Departmental Grant Appeals Board of the Department of\\n Health and Human Services, for instance, is composed of members appointed by the Secre-\\n tary. See 45 C.F.R. § 16.5(a) (1999). The Board was originally created by regulation but\\n later given added authority by Congress. See Pennsylvania v. HHS, 80 F.3d 796, 800 (3d\\n Cir. 1996). Although members of employee boards frequently have decisional independ-\\n ence as a matter of agency practice, see John H. Frye, Ill, Survey of Non-ALJ Hearing Pro-\\n grams in the Federal Government, 44 ADMIN. L. REV. 261, 343-44 (1992), they are not\\n technically \"independent\" because their members ordinarily can be removed without cause\\n by the appointing official, see Kalaris v. Donovan, 697 F.2d 376, 401 (D.C. Cir. 1983).\\n Moreover, we do not include advisory boards that are components of agencies, such as the\\n Social Security Advisory Board, see 42 U.S.C. § 903 (1994 & Supp. IV 1998), or other spe-\\n cialized government institutions, such as government corporations, government-sponsored\\n enterprises, or congressional agencies, some or all of whose members may be appointed by\\n the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and removable only for cause. See,\\n \\n 1114\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n Each agency is different because its procedures and practices have\\n evolved to facilitate the agency\\'s substantive mission.7 Yet some generali-\\n ties about agency operations can be gleaned. Moreover, we believe that\\n tradition matters. Lore can be as important as law. On one level, tradition\\n matters because the evolution of agency custom, and its culmination in es-\\n tablished practice, manifests a pragmatic adaptation of law to the needs of\\n individualized administration. On another level, it matters because it re-\\n flects the integration of accountability and efficiency. Generally speaking,\\n an evolving practice reflects a consensus (or at least an acceptance) among\\n agency members and staffs, the private sector, and the politically account-\\n able branches of government, of reasonable ways of doing business. Often,\\n agency practice becomes embodied in law.8\\n In order to understand the importance of the independent agency, it is\\n imperative to examine how it developed. We begin this article with a re-\\n view of the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), and\\n focus on how the independent agency form evolved, not from institutional\\n logic, but from historical contingency.9 Contrary to common belief, the\\n ICC was not devised to be a new independent form of government located\\n outside the tripartite system. Its resultant form was the product of political\\n e.g., 39 U.S.C. § 202(a) (1994 & Supp. IV 1998) (describing Postal Service Board of Gov-\\n ernors); Mail Order Ass\\'n of Am. v. United States Postal Serv., 986 F.2d 509, 512-13 (D.C.\\n Cir. 1993) (stating that nine members of Postal Service Board of Governors are appointed\\n by the President with advice and consent of Senate, and can be removed only for cause).\\n The information contained in the Appendix was reviewed in preliminary form by the Office\\n of General Counsel, or other staff office, within each agency. However, responsibility for\\n the accuracy of the material rests entirely with the authors.\\n 7. Indeed, one multi-member entity, the Railroad Retirement Board, is statutorily de-\\n fined as an \"independent agency,\" 45 U.S.C. § 231f(a) (1994), although it is not an\\n \"agency\" within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). See Administra-\\n tive Procedure Act § 2(a), 5 U.S.C. § 551(l)(E) (1994) (providing that an \"agency\" under\\n the Act does not include \"agencies composed of representatives of the parties or of repre-\\n sentatives of organizations of the parties to the disputes determined by them\").\\n 8. We undertake this article and survey for two reasons. First, these matters are the\\n grist of the day-to-day operations of federal agencies. Second, these issues do not appear to\\n command quite the same academic attention as doctrinal issues, and comparative data are\\n often unknown to agency and private practitioners. We share Professor Cass Sunstein\\'s\\n view that the next generation of administrative law scholarship should shift its focus from its\\n \"traditional preoccupation with the judiciary to a focus on congressional and bureaucratic\\n processes[,] ... [which] remain ill-understood despite the fact that they have far more im-\\n portant roles in government regulation.\" Cass R. Sunstein, Administrative Substance, 1991\\n DUKE L.J. 607, 642.\\n 9. \"[T]he independent commission as an organizational form did not emerge full-\\n blown with the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act. Rather, it evolved over the course\\n of several decades, coming to maturity late in the Progressive Era.\" MARC ALLEN EISNER,\\n REGULATORY POLITICS IN TRANSITION 48 (1993).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 1115\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n negotiations responding to the need for efficient regulation of the railroad\\n industry. In his authoritative work on independent agencies, Professor\\n Robert E. Cushman stated:\\n In the thinking of those responsible for the Act, independence, if it meant anything,\\n appears to have meant bipartisanship, as a guarantee of impartiality. Independence of\\n executive domination seems not to have been thought of and was certainly not dis-\\n cussed, but independence of one-sided partisan control was a matter of great mo-\\n ment. 1o\\n Cushman also notes:\\n There was virtually no discussion of the commission\\'s relation to Congress. Con-\\n gress was, of course, creating the commission and assigning its powers, but there is\\n nothing to suggest that the legislative leaders looked upon the commission as having\\n a relation to Congress different from that of any other administrative agency .... It\\n was assumed that the commission would aid Congress directly by giving it expert in-\\n formation on railroad problems, and it was also assumed that the commission would\\n remain under the supervision of Congress in the sense that its status and duties would\\n be subject to legislative revision from time to time.\"\\n It was not until many years after the establishment of the ICC that the\\n notion of independence developed.12     In the 1930s, Professor Isaiah L.\\n Sharfman, describing the agency form as manifested in the ICC, noted that\\n \"[t]he Commission is no more a part of the national administration-in the\\n sense of being an instrument for furthering the particular political ends of\\n the party in power-than is the Supreme Court, and executive influence is\\n as manifestly out of place in the one case as it would be in the other.\"\\'13\\n Throughout the Progressive Era and the New Deal, a multitude of new\\n agencies were established using the ICC as their prototype.14 As the inde-\\n pendent agency form began to flourish, its constitutionality became an is-\\n sue of considerable debate, and disputes over the issue of separation of\\n 10.

On\\n the other hand, the Brownlow Committee\\'s comments are equally wide off\\n the mark. The administrative process is not as unprincipled as the Com-\\n mittee portrays it. In our view, structural and organizational elements,\\n along with agency traditions and practices, have evolved together to permit\\n independent agencies to conduct their business fairly and effectively while\\n keeping them somewhat above the political fray. Agency structures, pro-\\n cedures and practices have grown up pragmatically rather than theoretically\\n to provide a reasonably impartial playing field for the resolution of factual\\n and policy issues in discrete areas of government activity. They reflect the\\n resolution of a tug-of-war between agency factions or the political branches\\n and allow policy warfare to be waged subtly, away from \"center court,\"\\n where affected interests can jockey for dominance. The actual operations\\n of independent agencies, if not the theory, are in effect, a sort of Marquis of\\n Queensbury rules of engagement, and their continued future existence in\\n one form or another will be necessary.\\n I. How DID THE INDEPENDENT AGENCY DEVELOP: THE CASE OF THE\\n INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION\\n A. Introduction\\n The emergence of the modem independent regulatory agency at the fed-\\n eral level began in the late 19th century when Congress established the ICC\\n to regulate the railroads. As a result, independence has come to be inextri-\\n cably associated with multi-member tribunals. However, prior to the es-\\n tablishment of the ICC, the regulatory commission structure had been util-\\n ized by many states in their attempts to regulate the railroad industry.15\\n Furthermore, the concept of independence did not originate with the\\n ICC.16 When Congress established the Department of the Treasury in\\n 1789, the department possessed indicia of independence from the executive\\n 15. \"Regulatory commissions were ... the normal outgrowth of a broader state com-\\n mission movement which dated back to the early nineteenth century.\" CUSHMAN, supra\\n note 10, at 19. ;\\'[I]n 1887, ten states had set up ;strong\\' commissions ... possessing actual\\n rate-making powers.\" Id. at 26.\\n 16. During the period before the Constitution, when there was no President, the Treas-\\n ury was controlled by a series of congressional committees and was accountable exclusively\\n to Congress. In 1784, Congress even experimented with a three-member Board of Treasury.\\n See MARK WALSTON, THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY 29 (1989).\\n \\n 1117\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n and indeed \"was not referred to as an \\'executive\\' department.\"7 For ex-\\n ample, Congress required the Secretary to report to Congress\" and re-\\n stricted the President\\'s power to remove the comptroller of the depart-\\n ment.19\\n Recent commentators have also made clear the extent to which district\\n attorneys (now called United States Attorneys) initially enjoyed some inde-\\n pendence from the executive branch.20 The early Attorneys General under-\\n stood the opinions clause of the Judiciary Act of 178921 to be a limitation\\n on their authority, \"rather than [the basis for] a general power to control le-\\n gal opinions throughout the executive branch.22 These Attorneys General\\n used the limitation as a justification for refusing to advise the district attor-\\n neys in their prosecutions, which gave the attorneys a level of independ-\\n ence. This practice is evident in a letter from Attorney General Wirt writ-\\n ten to President Monroe, dated October 20, 1823, in which Wirt expressed\\n his opinion after being asked to review the merits of a particular case.23 In\\n this letter, Wirt stated:\\n 17. GERHARD CASPER, SEPARATING POWER: ESSAYS ON THE FOUNDING PERIOD 42\\n (1997). \"in the Congress, the Secretary of Treasury was seen as an indispensable, direct\\n arm of the House in the regard to its responsibilities for revenues and appropriations.\" Id. at\\n 44. But see Steven G. Calabresi & Christopher S. Yoo, The Unitary Executive During the\\n First Half-Century, 47 CASE W. RES. L. REV. 1451, 1480-81 (1997) (describing President\\n Washington\\'s firm control over Treasury Department during his presidency).

In discussing regulation in Britain, we have relied on three principal sources. The\\n first is a book by historian Henry Parris. HENRY PARRIS, GOVERNMENT AND THE RAILWAYS\\n IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY BRITAIN (1965). The book is a revised version of Dr. Parris\\'s\\n Ph.D. thesis at the University of Leicester. At the time of writing, he was a Lecturer in\\n Politics at the University of Durham. The second is a book by economist C.D. Foster. C.D.\\n FOSTER, PRIVATIZATION, PUBLIC OWNERSHIP AND THE REGULATION OF NATURAL MONOPOLY\\n (1992). Sir Christopher Foster held a chair at the London School of Economics, was a Brit-\\n ish civil servant, and is a senior partner of Coopers and Lybrand. At the time of writing\\n during John Major\\'s Administration, he was special adviser to the U.K. Secretary of State\\n for Transport on railway privatization. The third source is an 1886 report by the Senate\\n Committee on Interstate Commerce that preceded passage of the Act to Regulate Commerce\\n of 1887. S. REP. No. 49-46, pt. 1 (1886).\\n 28.

The committee became convinced that competition. was-and would\\n be-insufficient to protect the public, and that intermittent remedial legis-\\n lation (such as laws that required rate reductions if railroad profits ex-\\n ceeded a fixed amount) could be easily evaded. Therefore, the select\\n committee proposed that Britain adopt some form of railroad regulation.29\\n Parliament followed that recommendation and in 1840 enacted the Rail-\\n way Regulation Bill that delegated to a government department, the Board\\n of Trade, powers that were the forerunner of modern railroad regulation.30\\n The board immediately created a Railway Department, which was an early\\n effort to establish a regulatory bureaucracy.3\\' Given that its power was\\n limited, the board proved to be ineffectural.32\\n In 1844, when a parliamentary committee again reviewed railroad regu-\\n lation, it proposed that the government acquire the railroads, and recom-\\n mended a twenty-one-year transition period.33 The board\\'s powers were\\n substantially reduced and the void was filled, to some extent, by the Rail-\\n way Department, which was now under the personal direction of the Presi-\\n dent of the Board of Trade.34 When the Whigs came to power in 1846,\\n Parliament enacted new legislation that established, for the first time, an\\n 29.

Railroads had to submit copies of their existing and future bylaws. The Board had\\n the discretion to disapprove them if it wished. See id. at 30. Although the bill also required\\n that railroads give the Board of Trade notice before opening a new line it lacked power to\\n prevent operation. See id. at 30, 37. The Board entertained complaints against railroads but\\n lacked power to act on them. See id at 42. Perhaps the most important power was the right\\n to comment on private bills, PARRIS, supra note 27, at 57-60 (describing Department\\'s par-\\n ticipation in legislative process), which were Parliament\\'s principal method of regulation\\n until the latter part of the nineteenth century. See FOSTER, supra note 27, at 17-18, 20 (de-\\n scribing use of private bills as regulatory devices). Private bills are advanced by groups or\\n bodies that seek special powers or authority above and beyond that conferred by the general\\n law. See DONALD SHELL, THE HouSE OF LORDs 176 (1988). Each new railway line or ex-\\n tension was the subject of a separate bill in Parliament, FOSTER, supra note 27, at 17-18, 20,\\n and these bills, also called \"parliamentary contracts,\" were effectively licenses, conferring\\n operational rights on railways, with conditions, such as a limit on dividends. Id. at 18. As\\n contracts involving private property, they were generally immune from subsequent legisla-\\n tion. See id. at 18. Overall, Parris describes the Board\\'s powers as \"neither numerous nor\\n extensive,\" PARRIS, supra note 27, at 30, and concludes that the private bill system \"did\\n more to protect private interests than to promote the public interest.\" Id. at 57. Foster\\n agrees that, until the 1880s, Parliament resisted any attempt to appoint commissioners with\\n significant power and status. See FOSTER, supra note 27, at 21.\\n 33. See S. REP.

What it saw as the chief anti-competitive evils were dis-\\n criminatory prices between long-haul and short-haul traffic and unduly\\n high rates. But it concluded that a statutory remedy for these perceived\\n abuses was impracticable. Its solution was a new tribunal \"to take supervi-\\n sion of the transportation interests of the kingdom ... with authority to en-\\n force the laws relating to railways and canals, to hear complaints and adjust\\n differences, and to advise Parliament upon questions of railway legisla-\\n ,,42\\n tion.

The joint committee believed that the courts, although\\n lacking in expertise, had historically coped reasonably well with issues sur-\\n rounding the reasonableness of rates, but were simply too expensive a fo-\\n rum. On the other hand, the Board of Trade had the expertise but was seen\\n as insufficiently \"judicial.\" Committees of Parliament were ruled out as an\\n effective regulatory mechanism because their membership was constantly\\n shifting.4  Thus, the solution was an expert, relatively permanent body\\n with the adjudicatory power.45\\n The new railway commission\\'s initial charter was for five years.46 But,\\n in 1886, Parliament introduced legislation that renamed the agency the\\n Railways and Canal Commission, made it permanent, required railroads to\\n submit certain traffic tables and tariffs,47 and gave the Commission addi-\\n tional power to control rates.48 The bill passed in 1888.49 It was the result\\n of nearly a half century of various efforts in Britain to develop a workable\\n regulatory framework.\\n 43. See id.

By and large, the\\n Board of Trade had attempted to regulate by encouraging railroads to lower rates in ex-\\n change for protection from competition. The Commission, in contrast, was essentially an\\n expert, adjudicatory tribunal that simply decided complaints brought before it. See FOSTER,\\n supra note 27, at 48.\\n \\n 1122\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n C. State Regulation in America\\n Railroad regulation in the United States emerged at about the same time\\n as in Britain. The intellectual impetus for government oversight, including\\n the form that it should take, was the brainchild of Charles Francis Adams,\\n Jr., the latest in a distinguished family line that included two U.S. Presi-\\n dents.50 Between 1866 and 1878, Adams wrote several influential articles\\n about the economics of railroad operation.5 He argued that the railroads, if\\n unsupervised, would become natural monopolies, but at the same time be-\\n lieved that government operation or regulation would stifle efficiency and\\n innovation. In his view, the state legislatures were ill-equipped to effec-\\n tively regulate the industry because politicians lacked the market knowl-\\n edge required. Legislatures also made political decisions to appease con-\\n stituents that stifled the market.    By contrast, industry experts who\\n understood the economics of the industry would render efficient regula-\\n tion.52 His proposal was the creation of a so-called \"sunshine commis-\\n sion,\" i.e., an impartial body of experts that would investigate, examine,\\n 53\\n and report on railroad activities but would not have enforcement power.\\n The Massachusetts Board of Railroad Commissioners, established in\\n 1869, reflected Adams\\' influence. It had three well-paid, nonpartisan\\n 50. Adams\\' father served as Minister, i.e., Ambassador, to Great Britain during the\\n Civil War. Raymond Seitz, appointed by President Bush as the only career diplomat ever to\\n serve as U.S. ambassador to Britain, considers Adams, Sr., the best U.S. ambassador to Brit-\\n ain in history. \"Largely through his own wits, Adams stopped the British from recognizing\\n the Southern Confederacy. Had London done so, transatlantic history would have been pro-\\n foundly and permanently transformed.\" RAYMOND SEITZ, OVER HERE 61 (1998).\\n 51. The most famous of which is his muckraking book entitled CHAPTERS OF ERIE AND\\n OTHER ESSAYS (1871), which he co-authored with Henry Adams. See also CHARLES\\n FRANCIS ADAMS, JR., RAILROADS: THEIR ORIGIN AND PROBLEMS (1878).\\n 52. \"The legislative branch could not do the job of intelligent regulation. \\'Knowledge\\n cannot possibly creep into the legislature, because no one remains in the legislature long\\n enough to learn.\\' In order to close the gap between public and private interests, analytical\\n expertise must somehow be made a permanent part of the government.\" THOMAS K.\\n McCRAw, PROPHETS OF REGULATION 15 (1984) (quoting and summarizing argument of\\n Charles Francis Adams, Jr.).\\n 53. See RICHARD J. STILLMAN, 11, CREATING THE AMERICAN STATE: THE MORAL\\n REFORMERS AND THE MODERN ADMINISTRATIVE WORLD THEY MADE 54-55 (1998) (\"Adams\\n understood the importance of the application of long-term expertise to public issues ....\\n Nonetheless, he distrusted giving too much authority to a permanent set of government offi-\\n cials who could, in the long run, abuse their power by operating beyond the boundaries of\\n community control or accountability.\"). Adams carefully evaluated Britain\\'s inability-as\\n of the mid-1870s-to create a commission with effective power.

Of the thirty-eight states then\\n in existence, twenty-eight had some form of railroad regulation.\" Of these,\\n twenty-four states had adopted a commission form.8 Only four relied on\\n judicial enforcement.59 Despite the prevalence of regulation at the state\\n level, the constitutional and geographic limitations on state agencies pre-\\n vented their regulatory control of large, interstate railroads.60 A consensus\\n on the need for a federal approach began to emerge.\\n Between 1868 and 1886, more than 150 railroad regulation bills were\\n introduced into Congress.61 Two competing approaches emerged. The\\n House, led by Representative John H. Reagan of Texas, viewed the com-\\n mission structure as a substitute for action rather than an effective remedy62\\n and urged legislation that provided for judicial enforcement.63 In contrast,\\n 54.

But this proved impractical, and the\\n states resorted to creation of administrative commissions to investigate and make rec-\\n ommendations to the legislature (the model in Massachusetts and many eastern\\n states), or themselves regulate the railroads (the model in .many Midwestern states).74\\n Congress was also familiar with the similar experience in Britain that led\\n to the establishment of a permanent railway commission pursuant to the\\n 68.

See 17 CONG. REc. 7292 (1886) (statement of Rep. Caldwell) (discussing British\\n commission). There were clearly some members of Congress who believed that Britain\\'s\\n efforts at railroad regulation had been ineffectual. See id. (\"England has passed many hun-\\n dred statutes in the abortive attempt to regulate these matters, and the greatest failure of all\\n the thirty-three hundred has been her commission.\"). Cushman argues, however, that the\\n British Railway Commission of 1873 influenced the movement toward creation of the ICC\\n but had \"a much better American reputation than it deserved.\" CUSHMAN, supra note 10, at\\n 512.\\n 76. See RICHARD D. STONE, THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION AND THE\\n RAILROAD INDUSTRY: A HISTORY OF REGULATORY POLICY 23 n.25 (1991) (noting Congress\\'\\n fear of allowing the President to directly influence railroad regulation).\\n 77. The limitation that not more than three members of the Commission could be from\\n the same political party evidenced their concern. Cushman states that \"[i]mpartiality, or at\\n least neutrality, was looked upon as more important than expertness.\" CUSHMAN, supra\\n note 10, at 63.\\n 78. See, e.g., 19 CONG. REC. 8576 (1888) (statement of Rep. Crisp) (stating that some\\n members considered the law establishing the ICC to be \"largely experimental\"). However,\\n the minority of the House committee that was prepared to accept a Commission form of\\n regulation preferred a regulatory entity within an existing cabinet department. See 17 CONG.\\n REC. 7285 (1886) (statement of Rep. O\\'Neill) (quoting from the minority report).\\n 79. Kolko claims that the railroads desired regulation to stop the rate wars that had\\n drastically driven rates down over the years and to regulate those companies who refused to\\n enter into, or abide by, pooling agreements. See KOLKO, supra note 26, at 30-31. Senator\\n Van Wyck of Nebraska argued that corporations sought national commissions as a lawful\\n method of self-protection. See 17 CONG. REC. 3825 (1886) (statement of Sen. Van Wyck)\\n (\"[C]orporations are becoming earnest advocates for a national commission, expecting it to\\n prevent them from being too severely squeezed in the tender embraces of each other . . \").\\n Congressman Reagan had a similar view. \"The Senate bill is ... preferred by the railroad\\n corporations,\" he claimed, \"because under it they see greater chances for trickery and eva-\\n sion; with whatever chances there may be for their controlling ... the commission .... .\" 17\\n CONG. REC. 7283 (1886) (statement of Rep. Reagan). \"Indeed, the railroads, not the farmers\\n and shippers, were the most important single advocates of federal regulation from 1877 to\\n 1916.

Place in the Executive Branch\\n Review of the original structure of the ICC helps to debunk the myth\\n that there was a tie between the commission form and independence Sec-\\n tions 18 and 21 of the original ICC Act placed the agency within the con-\\n trol of the Secretary of the Interior.82 ICC staff hires, salaries, and expen-\\n ditures were subject to the Secretary\\'s approval; the Secretary was also\\n responsible for furnishing the Commission with suitable offices and neces-\\n sary office supplies.83 The Commission\\'s annual report had to be submit-\\n ted to the Secretary who was, in turn, required to transmit it to Congress.4\\n 80. 18 CONG. REc. 171 (1886) (statement of Sen. Cullom).\\n 81. See KOLKO, supra note 26, at 44. Congress opted for a multi-member commission\\n within the Department of the Interior. Professor Kolko observes that the Senate had long\\n been an obstacle to railroad regulation and that, during the House-Senate conference, Con-\\n gressman Reagan was successful in retaining the central element of the House bill, namely\\n the anti-pooling provision (the Senate bill had no comparable provision). See id. at 43.\\n However, in doing so, he was forced to concede substantially to Senator Cullom\\'s views on\\n other matters. See id at 43; see also CULLOM, supra note 66, at 321-22 (noting that Reagan\\n yielded on nearly everything but the anti-pooling provision). Senator Cullom notes that\\n \"[tihere was a great fight in the Senate to secure the adoption of the conference report.\"\\n CULLOM, supra note 66, at 322.\\n 82. See Act of Feb. 4, 1887, ch. 104, §§ 18, 21, 24 Stat. 379, 386-87. The nineteenth\\n century Interior Department has been called \"the Department of the Great Miscellany.\"\\n LEONARD D. WHITE, THE REPUBLICAN ERA: 1869-1901, 175 (1958).\\n 83. See Act of Feb. 4, 1887, § 18. The office space provision was not unusual. The\\n Act of June 22, 1870, establishing the Department of Justice, required the superintendent of\\n the Treasury building to provide office space for the new department. See Act of June 22,\\n 1870, ch. 150, § 13, 16 Stat. 162, 164. That arrangement lasted until the present Justice De-\\n partment building was constructed. See Susan Low Bloch, The Early Role of the Attorney\\n General in Our Constitutional Scheme: In the Beginning There Was Pragmatism, 1989\\n DUKE L.J. 561, 620 n.188. Even today, such arrangements are used. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §\\n 7412(r)(6)(P) (1994) (requiring EPA Administrator to \"provide... such support and facili-\\n ties as may be necessary for operation of the [Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation]\\n Board.\"). The original ICC initially, and briefly, had two rooms in a building also occupied\\n by the Geological Survey, but the Commission was soon given more substantial quarters in\\n what was then the tallest privately owned building in Washington and one of the first to\\n have an elevator. The Commission moved again in 1917 as its need for space increased, and\\n moved again in 1934 into the building it occupied until the agency\\'s demise. See FRANK N.\\n WILNER, COMES Now THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE PRACTITIONER 58-59 (1993).\\n 84. See Act of Feb. 4, 1887, § 21.\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n There appears to have been little concern expressed over this arrangement\\n by the members of Congress, and \"whatever independence the new com-\\n mission was supposed to have was not incompatible with the location of\\n the commission in the Department of the Interior.\\'5\\n Two years later, the Secretary\\'s authority over the commission was\\n eliminated by statute and the commission became functionally independent\\n of the executive branch.86 That decision was not without controversy. Al-\\n though supported by both the commission and the Secretary of the Inte-\\n rior, several members of the House and Senate opposed the change.88\\n The statute was enacted two days before the inauguration of President\\n Benjamin Harrison, a Republican, and it has been argued that it was passed\\n by a Democratic Congress, in part, to free the commission from presiden-\\n tial influence.89 However, the initiative to separate the ICC from the Inte-\\n rior Department was prompted by both the commission, where Republican\\n 85. CUSHMAN, supra note 10, at 62. Cushman observes that placement of the ICC in\\n the Interior Department was essentially for housekeeping purposes, \"a sort of carry-over\\n from earlier proposals and a reflection of the idea that the new agency ought not to be left in\\n a vacuum.\" Id.\\n 86. Section 7 of the 1889 Act eliminated the requirement that the Secretary approve\\n salaries and expenses, and Section 8 authorized the Commission to submit reports directly to\\n Congress. See Act of Mar. 2, 1889, ch. 382, §§ 7-8, 25 Stat. 855, 861-62.\\n 87. See 19 CONG. REc. 6001 (1888) (statement of Sen.

Senator Teller\\n voiced concern that removing the Commission from the Department of the Interior would\\n bestow some independence upon it:\\n I do not think the objection that supervision is an annoyance to the Secretary of the\\n Interior or anything of that kind is sufficient. I do not think a body of this kind\\n should make its report to Congress. I think the report should be made to some De-\\n partment of the Government, and by it be transmitted to Congress.\\n Id.\\n 89. Brownlow states that \"Mr. Reagan of Texas, the author of the interstate commerce\\n bill, said that since a railroad lawyer named Ben Harrison had been elected President, he did\\n not trust the President any more with this matter, so he invented the idea of an independent\\n commission.\" Establishment of a Commission on Ethics in Government: Hearings Before\\n the Subcomm. to Study Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 of the Senate Comm. on Labor and\\n Pub.

No. 95-91, at 31 (1977)).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 1129\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n Thomas Cooley was chairman and its most influential member, and the\\n Secretary of the Interior. Moreover, it was supported by Senator Cullom, a\\n Republican, and a chief architect of both the original statute and the 1889\\n changes. He argued that the Interior Secretary\\'s oversight was \"purely\\n formal,\" and subjected both the commission and the Secretary to unneces-\\n sary administrative burdens without any countervailing benefits.90 Al-\\n though the change may have accorded with railroad objectives, it is un-\\n likely to have been prompted by partisan considerations. Such a significant\\n structural change could not have taken place without Senator Cullom\\'s\\n consent or at least acquiescence. Regardless, the intent was not to make the\\n commission independent and thereby vest it with authority to wield power\\n outside the domain of the executive branch.91\\n In 1906, influenced by the Progressive movement, Congress passed the\\n Hepburn Act, which empowered the ICC with rate-making authority,\\n making it a very powerful agency. Until this time, the agency, with little\\n discretionary power, had been rather weak and ineffectual, but the Progres-\\n sives saw the value in an entity removed from politics and promoted the in-\\n dependent form.\\n The Progressive movement emerged at the turn of the century. In re-\\n sponse to the growing number of corporate trusts and conglomerations, and\\n increasing distrust in government,92 legislation was enacted to \"eliminate or\\n 90. 19 CONG. REC. 5150 (1888) (statement of Sen. Cullom).\\n 91. It is worth noting that like Sherlock Holmes\\' \"curious incident of the dog in the\\n night-time\" none of the recent histories of the ICC that we have reviewed discuss this\\n structural change-one that to our modem understanding would be very significant indeed.\\n A. CONAN DOYLE, THE MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES 34 (1902) (\"\\'The dog did nothing\\n in the night-time.\\' \\'That was the curious incident,\\' remarked Sherlock Holmes\"). See, as\\n but one example, Au & OLIVE HOOGENBOOM, A HISTORY OF THE ICC: FROM PANACEA TO\\n PALLIATIVE 17-31 (1976). Among those who point it out, when discussing independent\\n agencies in general, are Paul R. Verkuil, The Status of Independent Agencies After Bowsher\\n v. Synar, 1986 DUKE L.J. 779, 780 n.7, and Strauss, supra note 5, at 609 n.140. Professor\\n Strauss notes that the ICC\\'s evolution reflects \"efforts to improve its practical workability\\n after the lessons of experience, not the result of a new theory about the proper ordering of\\n executive (or administrative) government; that came later.\" Strauss, supra note 5, at 609\\n n. 140 (citations omitted).\\n 92. Some commentators believe that this distrust in government encompassed the judi-\\n cial system as well. See MORTON J. HORWITz, THE TRANSFORMATION OF AMERICAN LAW\\n 1870-1960: THE CRISIS OF LEGAL ORTHODOXY 225 (1992) (\"As the Progressive disenchant-\\n ment with the competence of courts to perform social engineering tasks combined with a\\n loss of faith in the sensitivity of judges to questions of social justice, the effort to replace\\n courts with administrative experts became more pronounced.\"). Others suggest that the re-\\n form movement\\'s focus on expertise reflected the conquest and assertion of social status by\\n collectively self-defined experts.  See MAGALI SARFATTI LARSON, THE RISE OF\\n PROFESSIONALISM: A SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 138-47 (1977). In her view, the ideology of\\n \\n 1130\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n prevent those forms of industrial organization and corporate behavior,\\n which threatened to undermine market mechanisms .... The new regula-\\n tory regime was, in essence, market-corrective.93 The Progressives saw\\n the independent regulatory commission as an important conduit through\\n which market correction was administered. It was essential that the inde-\\n pendent regulatory commissions be staffed by expert administrators with\\n technical competence in the various areas of regulation. \"It was envisioned\\n as an institution capable of compensating for the shortcomings of the \\'po-\\n litical\\' institutions of American government.\"94 As one commentator has\\n noted about the Progressive movement, \"they honestly believed in the al-\\n most unlimited potential of science and administration.\"95     Reliance on\\n these experts coupled with independence from the political melee was\\n thought to safeguard the commissions from partisan politics, which would\\n enable the experts to make logical decisions based on empirical data.96\\n the new managerial class required neutrality, expertise and independence in government of-\\n ficials.

Discussions concerning the need for an antitrust commission\\n abounded. Prior to the creation of the FTC, the Senate Committee on Inter-\\n state Commerce clearly outlined the duties it believed an antitrust commis-\\n sion would need to perform.97 These duties were adopted and actually ex-\\n panded by the Federal Trade Commission Act. Proponents believed that\\n the commission should be quasi-judicial in character, and focused on this\\n concept as the basis for creating the new independent agency.98 It was also\\n believed that the FTC needed to be independent in order to correct \"the\\n partisan and pressure-controlled administration of the antitrust laws by the\\n Department of Justice.\"99 Senator Newlands, a strong supporter of the in-\\n dependent agency concept, stated that \"we want a body of administrative\\n law built up. This can not [sic] be well done by the single occupant of an\\n office .... Such work must be done by a board or commission of dignity,\\n permanence, and ability, independent of executive authority .... too\\n Finally, the FTC was created in 1914.101 It was assigned the task of de-\\n termining and preventing \"unfair methods of competition,\"\\',02 and had the\\n authority to issue \"cease and desist\" orders\\'03 against offenders-duties that\\n afforded the new agency far more power than the 1887 ICC. The FTC was\\n modeled after the ICC primarily for \"its independent power and author-\\n ity.\\'1°4  Many believed that the only way to achieve effective business\\n regulation was to establish a trade commission completely removed from\\n 97. See CUSHMAN, supra note 10, at 183 (\"The duties that such a commission would\\n perform were outlined by the committee: first, extensive activities in the field of investiga-\\n tion; second, the administration of some system of licensing corporations engaged in inter-\\n state commerce; and third, the rendering of expert aid to the courts and to the Department of\\n Justice in the dissolution of trusts and other unlawful combinations.\").\\n 98. See id. at 190-91 (discussing view of supporters that independence from the execu-\\n tive was necessary because of quasi-judicial nature of new Commission\\'s work).\\n 99. Id. at 189. Some senators and congressmen did stress independence from the ex-\\n ecutive branch. Senator Newlands expressed the importance of a committee \"independent\\n of executive authority except in its selection, and independent in character.\" Id. at 190 (cit-\\n ing 51 CONG. REc. 11,092 (1914) (statement of Sen. Newlands)).\\n 100. 51 CONG. REc. 11,092 (1914) (statement of Sen. Newlands).\\n 101. See Act of Sept. 26, 1914, ch. 311, 38 Stat. 717.\\n 102. Id. § 5. The phrase \"unfair methods of competition\" proved to be very ambiguous\\n and the Commission\\'s authority to define it was challenged repeatedly in the courts. The\\n enabling statute allowed the courts to fetter the Commission for several years. For a de-\\n scription of how the Commission was hobbled, see THOMAS C.

Senator Morgan stressed this point repeatedly, stating that \"[w]hatever we do in\\n regulating business should be removed as far as possible from political influence.\" Id. at\\n 190 (quoting 51 CONG. REc. 8857 (1914) (statement of Sen. Morgan)).\\n 106. Id. at 191.\\n 107. Id. at 192 (\"This confidence, particularly upon the part of the business world, was\\n felt to be of vital importance. Sound policy with respect to business regulation could hardly\\n emerge in an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust.\").\\n 108. The scientific expert was seen as one removed from partisan politics. While ends\\n were to be decided by the political branches, means were better chosen by impartial admin-\\n istrative experts. Commentators of the time described the scientific-expert as the man who\\n \"knows how and why.\" See SAMUEL HABER, EFFICIENCY AND UPLIFT: SCIENTIFIC\\n MANAGEMENT IN THE PROGESSIVE ERA 1890-1920 105 (1964) (internal quotation marks and\\n citation omitted) (emphasis omitted). Haber claims that the \"scientific expert became the\\n prototype of all administrators.\" Id. at 104. The notion that expertness is essential for ef-\\n fective regulation has endured. New Deal theorist James Landis asserted that \"[w]ith the\\n rise of regulation, the need for expertness became dominant.\" JAMES M. LANDIS, THE\\n ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS 23 (1938). He articulated the advantages to be gained by reliance\\n on a specialized group with the skill, experience, and time to dedicate to the resolution of\\n regulatory issues. See id. at 23-26.\\n 109. See BURTON J. BLEDSTEIN, THE CULTURE OF PROFESSIONALISM: THE MIDDLE CLASS\\n AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN AMERICA 38, 126-28 (1976) (discussing\\n expanded use of titles such as \"doctor\" or \"engineer,\" and increased emphasis on higher\\n education).\\n 110. See HABER, supra note 108, at 107-08 (describing Frederick W.

This notion was pioneered by such men as Professor Frank J. Goodnow who wrote\\n several influential articles around the turn of the century espousing the importance of sepa-\\n rating politics from administration. \"Many of the progressive reformers who seized upon\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 1133\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n politicians such as Louis D. Brandeis\\'12 and Woodrow Wilson\\'13 advanced\\n the cause of scientific management.\\n With the creation of the FTC, it was clear that the ICC would serve as\\n the template for a multitude of new independent regulatory commissions in\\n the early twentieth century. As Professor Cushman has pointed out, \"[a]\\n controlling force moving legislative leaders to create the independent Fed-\\n eral Trade Commission was the model of the Interstate Commerce Com-\\n mission.\",14 As the number of commissions grew, the indicia of independ-\\n ence were defined by replication.\"\\'\\n Goodnow\\'s formula did so with the intent of creating an honored and important profession\\n of administrators having special skills and a special ethic.\" Id. at 103.\\n 112. See McCRAw, supra note 52, at 92 (noting Brandeis\\' support for \"scientific man-\\n agement\" techniques to improve efficiency). Brandeis used scientific management as a tool\\n with which to club monopolies. In 1910, he represented shippers\\' interests before the ICC\\n in the Advance Rate Case. The railroads sought an across-the-board rate increase for freight\\n hauls which was vehemently opposed by the shipping industry. Brandeis successfully ar-\\n gued that the solution for the railroad companies was efficiency rather than a rate increase.\\n The rate increase was denied. As one commentator concluded, \"[t]he Brandeis view of sci-\\n entific management allowed a politically insecure and institutionally limited ICC to take\\n refuge in a strong disciplinary posture in administrative regulation.\" STEPHEN SKOWRONEK,\\n BUILDING A NEW AMERICAN STATE: THE EXPANSION OF NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE\\n CAPACITIES, 1877-1920 269-70 (1982).\\n 113.

See, e.g., Parsons v. United States, 167 U.S. 324, 343 (1897) (concluding that U.S.\\n Attorney is removable by President through appointment of new U.S. Attorney despite the\\n existence of four-year term of office); Chabal v.

The court in Chabal rested its decision in part on the mar-\\n shal\\'s status as a \"purely executive\" officer, Chabal, 841 F.2d at 1218-19, a ground under-\\n mined by the Supreme Court\\'s 1988 decision in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 689\\n (1988).

From time to time when regu-\\n latory powers are conferred on cabinet departments, Congress decides to place the adjudica-\\n tion of cases in the hands of a separate, multi-member Board in what has come to be known\\n as the split-enforcement model. For example, employers opposed the traditional arrange-\\n ment when Congress created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration as part of\\n the Department of Labor. So, Congress placed adjudication responsibilities in the hands of\\n the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

Appointments\\n Members of independent, multi-member agencies are generally ap-\\n pointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,133 but\\n not always. For example, the chairman of the National Indian Gaming\\n Commission is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of\\n the Senate, but the other two members are appointed by the Secretary of the\\n Interior.\\'3\\' All members serve three-year terms and can only be removed\\n from office for good cause.135  At the Board of Veterans\\' Appeals, the\\n chairman is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the\\n Senate to a six-year term, but other board members are appointed by the\\n Secretary of Veterans\\' Affairs, with the approval of the President, based on\\n a recommendation by the board chairman.\\'36\\n Appointments to regulatory boards and commissions reflect a variety of\\n considerations. Typically, agency statutes require political balance, i.e., no\\n more than a bare majority of members of multi-member agencies may\\n come from the same political party, but there are exceptions. The statutes\\n governing the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety\\n and Health Review Commission, and the Federal Mine Safety and Health\\n Review Commission, among others, contain no requirements pertaining to\\n political balance.13\\' Geography can also play a role. For example, no more\\n than one member of the Federal Reserve Board may be appointed from any\\n one Federal Reserve District.\\'38\\n The original Act to Regulate Commerce did not require professional or\\n other specific qualifications for agency membership. Most contemporary\\n statutes follow that model. Some, however, do require certain qualifica-\\n tions.139 Apparent congressional inattention to detail creates some anoma-\\n 133. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. § 241 (1994) (Federal Reserve Board); 47 U.S.C. § 154(a)\\n (1994) (Federal Communications Commission).\\n 134. See 25 U.S.C. § 2704(b)(1) (1994).

See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7101(b)(1), 7101A(a) (1994 & Supp. IV 1998). There is no con-\\n stitutional prohibition on presidential appointees serving on decisional bodies with members\\n whom they can appoint and remove. See Silver v. United States Postal Serv., 951 F.2d\\n 1033, 1040-41 (9th Cir. 1991).\\n 137. See 29 U.S.C. § 153(a) (1994) (NLRB); 29 U.S.C. § 661(a) (1994) (OSHRC); 30\\n U.S.C. § 823(a) (1994) (FMSHRC).

The members of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board must be\\n experts in nuclear safety40 but members of the Nuclear Regulatory Com-\\n mission need not.141 Some statutes contain precatory language without\\n genuinely circumscribing the President\\'s choices in any significant way.\\n For example, members of the Postal Rate Commission \"shall be chosen on\\n the basis of their professional qualifications.\"\\'\\'42 Members of the Federal\\n Reserve Board must be selected with \"due regard to a fair representation of\\n the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests, and geo-\\n graphical divisions of the country.\\'43\\n Some multi-member agencies have a tradition of members being se-\\n lected from the ranks of the agency staff. According to a major study of\\n regulatory agencies by the Senate Government Operations Committee in\\n 1977, four of the nineteen appointments to the Securities and Exchange\\n Commission (SEC) between 1961 and 1977 were career staff employees.144\\n Not surprisingly, many regulatory commission appointments are made\\n from among individuals closely associated with the regulated industry. In-\\n deed, leading representatives of the regulated sector are often consulted on\\n agency appointments.145 Moreover, many agency appointees have the sup-\\n port of a key member of Congress. The Senate Government Operations\\n Committee found that no less than a third of the appointments to the FTC\\n and the FCC during the period studied were almost entirely the result of\\n congressional sponsorship,46 which is evidence that partisan considerations\\n can override issues of expertise, experience, or even regulatory philoso-\\n phy.147\\n tion. Moreover, at least one member must have professional or business experience in the\\n private sector. See 49 U.S.C. § 701(b)(2) (Supp. IV 1998). At least two of the three mem-\\n bers of the National Indian Gaming Commission must be enrolled in an Indian tribe. See 25\\n U.S.C. § 2704(b)(3).\\n 140. See 42 U.S.C. § 2286(b)(1) (1994).\\n 141.

Section 5503 of Title 5 of\\n the U.S. Code prohibits payment to recess appointees except in three cir-\\n cumstances: if (1) the vacancy occurred within thirty days of the end of a\\n congressional session; (2) a nomination was pending when the Senate re-\\n cessed; or (3) a nomination was rejected within thirty days before a recess\\n and another individual receives the recess appointment.149 Therefore, there\\n may be some situations where the President has the constitutional power to\\n make a recess appointment but must find a recess appointee willing to work\\n without receiving monetary compensation.\\n 3. Removalfrom Office\\n The Constitution does not address, in express terms, the respective roles\\n of the President and Congress with respect to the removal of federal offi-\\n cers. Whether Congress may, by legislative enactment, limit or restrict the\\n President\\'s removal power grew to be the subject of great debate and the\\n 148. See U.S. CONST. art. II, § 2, cl. 3; United States v. Woodley, 751 F.2d 1008, 1012-\\n 13 (9th Cir. 1985) (en banc) (holding that President has authority to \"fill all vacancies that\\n exist during a recess of Senate\"); 3 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 314, 314 (1979) (stating that re-\\n cess appointment power applies to vacancies that occur during a recess regardless of when\\n vacancies arose). Whether brief, intra-session breaks constitute a \"recess\" for constitutional\\n purposes is a difficult question. The Justice Department\\'s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC),\\n whose most recent pronouncement on the subject is The Constitutional Separation of Pow-\\n ers Between the President and Congress, 1996 OLC LEXIS 6, at * 122 (May 7, 1996), ar-\\n gues that the term \"recess\" must be given a practical construction and the President is enti-\\n tled to make a good-faith determination of whether a given recess is sufficient to trigger his\\n recess appointment powers. Recess appointees have the same powers while in office that\\n they would have if appointed with Senate confirmation. The President may use his recess\\n appointment power to fill vacant positions or replace agency members who are continuing\\n to serve beyond their ordinary statutory term (so-called \"holdover\" members). See Swan v.\\n Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 988 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (upholding recess appointment to replace\\n holdover member of National Credit Union Administration); Staebler v.

The Supreme Court in Parsons v. United States determined that\\n the President could remove a district attorney for the good of the country\\n although he was appointed to a four year term.\\'51 In Shurtleff v. United\\n States, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the President\\'s removal of\\n a member of a board of appraisers that was established by Congress.152\\n Congress had provided for removal only for inefficiency, neglect of duty,\\n or malfeasance in office but the court reasoned that the President\\'s general\\n power of appointment provided justification for removal of the officer.53\\n These cases forecasted the court\\'s later decision in Myers v. United\\n States. \\'54\\n The issue of removal received judicial examination in a trilogy of well-\\n known 20th century Supreme Court decisions. In the first, Myers v. United\\n States, the Court concluded that the President\\'s power to appoint carries\\n with it the power to remove.55 Chief Justice Taft\\'s opinion for the major-\\n ity, and the dissenting opinions, extensively reviewed the history of the is-\\n sue. The majority concluded that the removal power is \"incident to the\\n power of appointment\" and therefore resides exclusively with the Presi-\\n dent.156 It interpreted the \"take care\" clause of the Constitution broadly and\\n resolved that the President\\'s power to remove officials was plenary so\\n Congress was proscribed from implementing changes to or limiting the\\n power. Several years later, however, in Humphrey\\'s Executor v. United\\n States, the Court limited the broad scope of the Myers decision by con-\\n cluding that the President\\'s removal power constitutionally could be condi-\\n tioned by Congress in certain circumstances and upholding a statutory \"for\\n 150. Interestingly, congressional debates over the establishment of the ICC contain very\\n little discussion about removal power and the influence the executive branch would have\\n over the agency. Rather, the removal clause contained in the 1887 Act to Regulate Com-\\n merce was included as a safeguard against unwanted commissioners.

See Reviewing the Performance of the Social Security\\n Administration as an Independent Agency: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Social Security\\n of the House Comm. on Ways and Means, 104th Cong. 12 & n. 19 (1996) (testimony of Ro-\\n gelio Garcia, Congressional Research Service) [hereinafter SSA Hearing].\\n 162. 487 U.S. 654 (1988).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 1143\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n that neither the organizational structure and placement of the agency nor\\n the duties of an agency official per se affect Congress ability to confer\\n some measure of independence by restricting removal power functions.163\\n Rather, the issue is whether \"the removal restrictions are of such a nature\\n that they impede the President\\'s ability to perform his constitutional duty\"\\n to see that the laws are faithfully executed.164\\n After Morrison, the fact that a presidential appointee performs any ex-\\n ecutive functions no longer automatically immunizes that official from\\n congressional efforts to restrict the President\\'s removal power.65 Nor is it\\n critical that such appointee serves on a multi-member board \"outside\" the\\n executive branch-which is logical since the first \"independent\" official of\\n government, after all, was the Comptroller of the Treasury Department.66\\n Although Morrison dealt with an \"inferior\" officer, i.e., one not appointed\\n by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, both Hum-\\n phrey\\'s Executor and Wiener dealt with the President\\'s removal power\\n over officers appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\\n Thus, there are issues that will be argued in the future, but for now, the le-\\n gitimacy of the independent agency has been validated.67\\n There are other issues concerning removal power other than the scope of\\n the President\\'s authority. Agency statutes are typically silent as to (a) a\\n definition of the statutory grounds for removal or (b) what procedures must\\n be followed before a President may remove a member of an independent\\n agency for cause.\\n a.

In its Wiener decision, the court suggested that removal for cause\\n had to involve \"the rectitude\" of the government official.\\'71 In Humphrey\\'s\\n Executor, the President had expressly requested Humphrey\\'s resignation\\n because the commissioner\\'s views did not coincide with those of the Presi-\\n dent on \"either the policies or the administering of the Federal Trade\\n Commission.\"\\'72 The court at least impliedly concluded that such ground\\n was not embraced within a \"for cause\" standard. However, in Bowsher v.\\n Synar, the Supreme Court noted that the terms are \"very broad.\\'    Profes-\\n sors Lessig and Sunstein suggest that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the\\n \"for cause\" provisions can be interpreted to allow a President to remove an\\n independent agency member under a broad array of circumstances, includ-\\n ing a commissioner\\'s frequent or important failure to follow the President\\'s\\n wishes with respect to what is required by sound policy.74 Professor Peter\\n Strauss argues that the President\\'s request for Humphrey\\'s resignation was\\n \"founded in failure of trust, not breach of discipline,\" so the case does not\\n fully answer the question of what consequences might follow from a com-\\n missioner\\'s failure to honor specific presidential policy directives.75 He\\n 168.

For example, the statute gov-\\n erning the National Indian Gaming Commission employs the language\\n \"neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, or for other good cause\\n shown\"178-a hint, at least, that Congress sees neglect of duty and malfea-\\n sance in office as illustrations of a generic \"good cause\" ground for re-\\n moval. Some agency statutes are silent with regard to the President\\'s\\n power to remove agency members from office.179 But since the cotirt in\\n Wiener read into a silent statute a limitation on the President\\'s removal\\n power because of the agency\\'s intrinsic adjudicatory character, 18 it can be\\n fairly assumed that the absence of \"for cause\" removal language does not\\n automatically preclude the imposition of such a limitation.\\n dicatory purpose of War Claims Commisson precluded President\\'s removal of commis-\\n sioner at will).

Procedures for Removal\\n Most agency statutes are silent on what procedures (if any) the President\\n must follow before removing an agency member from office for good\\n cause.18\\' However, as early as the turn of the century, the Supreme Court\\n indicated that \"for cause\" appointees were entitled to notice and hearing be-\\n fore they could be removed from office.82 The Supreme Court\\'s due proc-\\n ess jurisprudence of the 1970s does nothing to undermine this conclusion.\\n An agency member\\'s constitutional claim depends on having a property\\n right in continuing employment.83 Job security created by statute has been\\n held to be a property right.84 Thus, if the member has a statutory right to\\n continued employment, he or she cannot be deprived of the job without due\\n process.85 However, that jurisprudence also teaches that due process re-\\n quires only \"such procedural protections as the particular situation de-\\n mands.\"\\'86  Generally, something less than a full APA-style evidentiary\\n hearing is sufficient to satisfy constitutional requirements.87\\n 181. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 5841(e) (1994) (Nuclear Regulatory Commission).\\n 182. See Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311, 313-14 (1903) (concluding that where\\n removal is sought pursuant to statute for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in\\n office... the officer is entitled to notice and a hearing\"); Reagan v. United States, 182 U.S.\\n 419, 425 (1901) (stating that where causes of removal are specified by Constitution or stat-\\n ute, \"notice and hearing are essential\"). In Shurtleff the court also determined that inclusion\\n of explicit causes for removal did not, in the context of that statute, prevent the President\\n from removing the individual for other reasons. However, the court hinged that aspect of its\\n decision on the lack of any fixed term of office. A different construction of the statute, Jus-\\n tice Peckham observed, would \"give an ... [official] the right to hold that office during his\\n life or until he shall be found guilty of some act specified in the statute. If this be true, a\\n complete revolution in the general tenure of office is effected... \" Shurtleff 189 U.S. at\\n 316. That is no longer an issue under modem statutes.

It creates different procedural requirements depending on\\n which member is sought to be removed. The chairman may only be re-\\n moved by the President for specified cause, while other members of the\\n board may be removed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for poor per-\\n formance or other causes. The chairman may be removed only \"after no-\\n tice and opportunity for hearing,\"\\'9 while other board members may be\\n removed either following a specific set of statutorily-delineated procedures,\\n if removal is based on performance, or after an Administrative Procedure\\n Act (APA) hearing, if removal is based on other causes. 90\\n Neither the \"notice and hearing\" requirement contained in the NLRB,\\n FLRA, and Board of Veterans\\' Appeals statutes, nor due process consid-\\n erations require the President to follow the strictures contained within the\\n APA. The APA is applicable only when an adjudication is \"required by\\n statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency\\n hearing.\\',\\'9\\' None of the agency statutes that provide for \"notice and hear-\\n ing\" uses the talismanic \"on the record\" formulation, and the Supreme\\n Court attaches some significance to it.\\'92 Although the lack of the \"on the\\n record\" language is not dispositive, 93 the omission of the phrase may be\\n construed as evidence that Congress intended for something other than an\\n APA hearing.194 In fact, in the Board of Veterans\\' Appeals statute, Con-\\n through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute pro-\\n cedural safeguards; and (3) the government\\'s interest, including the administrative and fi-\\n nancial burdens to the government of additional or substitute procedures.

During the Roosevelt Administration, the\\n Budget Bureau issued Budget Circular 336, which affirmatively required \"by direction of\\n the President\" that \"all agency proposals for legislation and all reports on pending legisla-\\n tion be cleared through the Budget Bureau.\" Id at 649-50 (emphasis added).

Other statutes require that an agency\\'s legislative proposals be\\n transmitted simultaneously to Congress and the President.2I\\' The concur-\\n rent submission provision does not, on its face, prohibit OMB from sug-\\n gesting (or even requiring) changes, but ensures that Congress will be ap-\\n prised of the agency\\'s original position. Some statutes have a mix of these\\n procedures.212 Five agencies, although lacking express statutory authority,\\n send communications to Congress without submitting them first to OMB.\\n They appear to assert their historic status as independent regulatory agen-\\n 206.

Litigation Authority\\n Currently, except as otherwise authorized by statute, the conduct of the\\n federal government\\'s litigation rests with the Attorney General.215 How-\\n ever, Professor Neal Devins has correctly observed that \"[t]he reach of the\\n Department of Justice control in general and Solicitor General control in\\n particular is ill-suited to generalization.216 Congress has authorized vari-\\n ous independent agencies to represent themselves in court in certain situa-\\n tions. As Professor Moreno points out, control over litigation was a much\\n debated issue when the ICC was created.217 The original Act to Regulate\\n Commerce placed the enforcement of ICC orders in the hands of the fed-\\n eral district attorneys, under the direction of the Attorney General.218 The\\n 1889 amendments left the ICC\\'s litigation relationship with the Justice De-\\n partment unchanged.219 But statutory changes in 1906 divided litigation\\n responsibility between the agency and the executive branch. The Justice\\n Department retained responsibility for ICC orders involving the payment of\\n money, while the commission obtained authority \"in its own name\" to seek\\n enforcement of all other orders.22° Under the currently effective Adminis-\\n 213.

The changes enacted clearly gave the Attorney\\n General litigation authority over cases in the Commerce Court (which then included en-\\n forcement of all ICC orders other than those for the payment of money), but it gave the ICC\\n the right to appear as a party through its own lawyers in all cases involving the validity of\\n ICC orders and to represent itself in the Supreme Court when the Solicitor General declined\\n to do so.

Political Will Theory\\n Some commentators believe that in order to understand how independent\\n agencies operate, variables that impact upon agencies, other than their\\n structural organization and indicia of independence, must be analyzed.\\n Professor Neal Devins believes that the \"the focus of agency analysis\\n should encompass interbranch power and expectations as well as agency\\n structure.255 In his article, Political Will and the Unitary Executive: What\\n Makes an Independent Agency Independent?, Professor Devins claims that\\n political will exerted by the President, Congress, and independent agencies\\n invariably affects the outcome of power struggles, notwithstanding the in-\\n dependent structure of the agency. Devins discusses executive litigation\\n control and compares the effect of political will in several recent controver-\\n sies concerning litigation authority. His study demonstrates that a Presi-\\n dent, who adheres to a strong paradigm of the unitary executive and strate-\\n gically exerts political will in an altercation, can be victorious,\\n notwithstanding a structurally independent agency.\\n There is a theoretical debate among commentators over whose interests\\n the DOJ should represent when it controls litigation. There are several\\n models that serve to justify the respective views. Under the bureaucratic\\n theory of representation-the most common model-the agency is the\\n policy-making client and the DOJ acts as the agency\\'s advocate.256 Oppo-\\n nents of this model promote the theory of the unitary executive and main-\\n tain that the DOJ represents the policies of the President to secure a unified\\n executive branch through policy coordination and centralization.257 Devins\\n argues that while structural factors such as litigation and removal authority\\n 254. This adjudicative function is highlighted if one examines a comparative decision\\n not to prosecute-the decision of Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubenstein not to indict\\n former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because he lacked sufficient evidence.

See id.\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n 1160\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n often influence the choice of models, political will is the principal factor\\n that determines which of these models will prevail.258  When the DOJ\\n wields litigation authority, for example, the President can successfully im-\\n plement his policies and coordinate the executive branch if he strategically\\n exerts his will. Devins illustrates this point by comparing the different ap-\\n proaches adopted by the Carter and Reagan administrations. During the\\n Carter administration, Attorney General Griffin Bell believed that the DOJ\\n should advocate the position of the agency and took pains to shield the So-\\n licitor General\\'s office from White House political will.259 In sharp con-\\n trast, both Presidents Reagan and Bush forcefully exerted their will to cen-\\n tralize the executive branch, and during their administrations, the DOJ\\n proved to be an effective conduit through which policy was implemented\\n and advanced.26°\\n During the Reagan administration, a power struggle reflecting these con-\\n flicting philosophies arose between the EEOC and the DOJ.26\\' In 1983, the\\n DOJ discovered that the EEOC was preparing to file an amicus brief in\\n Williams v. City of New Orleans261 in support of affirmative action, which\\n contradicted a brief previously filed by the DOJ.263 Although the multi-\\n member commission has authority to litigate certain employment discrimi-\\n nation issues involving private parties before lower federal courts, the DOJ\\n has exclusive authority to litigate matters concerning state and local gov-\\n ernments.264 The DOJ viewed the EEOC\\'s amicus brief as an attempt to\\n thwart its exclusive litigating authority.265 The situation was further com-\\n plicated by the fact that the EEOC had been instrumental in ensuring that\\n federal agencies implemented affirmative action plans under the Carter\\n administration and that during the Carter administration, the Solicitor Gen-\\n eral had allowed the EEOC to file briefs conflicting with the DOJ\\'s\\n briefs.266 In contrast, the Reagan administration wanted the executive\\n 258.

Faced with a DOJ opinion asserting\\n sole litigating authority, the EEOC surrendered.267\\n An independent agency\\'s efforts to exert political will are bolstered by\\n several tools it has at its disposal. Its organizational structure and enabling\\n statute provide the agency with a measure of independent authority. The\\n greater the authority allocated to the agency by Congress, the greater its\\n freedom from the executive branch. Often, though, the measure of an in-\\n dependent agency\\'s political will is dependent upon the actions of Con-\\n gress or the President, or their failure to intercede.268 A vigilant President\\n will make it more difficult for an agency to effectuate its own policies.\\n Likewise, if Congress chooses to, it can closely regulate an agency through\\n legislation and oversight. Although Congress defines the parameters of the\\n agency\\'s powers through legislation, it would be inefficient and perhaps\\n even contrary to congressional self-interest to regulate agencies\\' daily ac-\\n tivities in this manner. For example, public choice theorists claim that\\n members of Congress often seek to pacify and appease powerful special\\n interest groups to ensure future campaign contributions and support.269\\n Agency action that is sympathetic to a given member\\'s contributors will be\\n welcomed by that member. Thus, congressional relationships with interest\\n groups may give an agency more flexibility and another source of political\\n power.\\n In 1992, the United States Postal Service (Postal Service) was successful\\n in thwarting the will of President Bush by strategically exerting its own\\n political will. A dispute arose between the Postal Service and the Postal\\n gave the EEOC authority to develop standards and guidelines that federal agencies should\\n follow in complying with equal opportunity laws.

Not only did he ignore the independent structure of the Postal Service,\\n but he tried to \"strong-arm\" the board members after he lost the 1992 elec-\\n tion.\\n One ought not read this incident, however, as reflecting a secular dimi-\\n nution of presidential control of agency behavior generally. The President\\n was in the waning days of his administration and his political power was\\n largely emasculated, a point which the board members used to their ad-\\n vantage.

These internal procedures\\n must not be inconsistent with explicit statutory requirements. Nonetheless,\\n most have been developed and shaped by case law and custom or adopted\\n from other agencies.\\n A. Institutional Decisionmaking\\n 1. Powers of the Chair\\n There is no doubt that the chair of a multi-member agency is ordinarily\\n its most dominant figure. Most agency chairs are appointed to their posi-\\n tions by the President and are members of his political party. They often\\n come to an agency to advance the President\\'s agenda-or their own-but\\n some come with no agenda. Former Tariff Commissioner Dan H. Fenn ob-\\n served:\\n The Chairman, when I was appointed, believed that the Commission should be quiet\\n and unobtrusive. He liked to refer to [the agency) as a fire department, with its staff\\n wrapping hoses and keeping the equipment in good repair against the day when the\\n alarm would ring, when someone would knock on the door with a case to be consid-\\n ered. He might, some of us thought, have added that the first effort in such an event\\n would be to persuade the petitioner to try some other firehouse down the street.275\\n The legal relationship between the agency chairman and his or her col-\\n leagues is statutorily established but nonetheless ambiguous.276 It is a fre-\\n 275. 1 SENATE COMM. ON Gov\\'T OPERATIONS, STUDY ON FEDERAL REGULATION, S.\\n Doc. No. 95-25, at 17 (1977) (citation omitted) (alternation in original). One agency-the\\n FEC-still selects its own Chairman and Vice Chairman annually. That commission de-\\n cides uniquely partisan issues as part of its supervisory role over the election process and its\\n participants. To help ensure that neither major political party can wrest management control\\n of the Commission for a sustained period, Congress has provided that the chairmanship ro-\\n tates among the members, that a commissioner may serve as Chairman only once during his\\n or her term, and that the Commission\\'s Chairman and Vice Chairman may not come from\\n the same political party. See 2 U.S.C. § 437c(a)(5) (1994).\\n 276. There is some variation in the rate of pay of members of independent agencies that\\n appears to reflect both a rough congressional hierarchy of importance and idiosyncratic con-\\n siderations. Generally speaking, chairmen are paid more than their colleagues. Presidential\\n appointees are paid at one of five levels, with Level I being the highest. The Commissioner\\n of Social Security is paid at Executive Level I, the same rate as cabinet secretaries. The\\n Chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board and the NRC, are the highest-paid heads of multi-\\n member agencies at Executive Level I1. 5 U.S.C. § 5313 (1994 & Supp. IV 1998). As of\\n January, 1997, officials at Executive Level II were paid $133,600. See Exec. Order No.\\n 13,033, 3 C.F.R. 245 (1996), reprinted in 5 U.S.C. § 5332, at 252. Executive Level II is\\n also the rate of pay for deputy cabinet secretaries and the Administrator of the Environ-\\n mental Protection Agency. Most regulatory Commission chairmen are paid at Executive\\n \\n 1164\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n quent source of interest to members at virtually every multi-member\\n agency, particularly those who are new to the job, and can be a cause for\\n contention. Although the respective powers of a chairman and the agency\\n as an institution differ from agency to agency, most chairmen are essen-\\n tially the agencies\\' chief executive and administrative officers. They ap-\\n point and supervise the staff, distribute business among the agency\\'s per-\\n sonnel and administrative units, and control the preparation of the agency\\'s\\n budget and the expenditure of funds.277     But that does not mean that the\\n other agency members play no role in the agency\\'s management or admini-\\n stration. Professor David Welborn points out:\\n One of the major difficulties is finding that delicate balance point at which the mem-\\n bers generally are engaged in the large questions in a positive way, but without con-\\n stricting the chairman in caring for his essential functions. There are no magic for-\\n mulas for locating the balance. The evidence suggests, however, that the [agencies]\\n almost never give systematic and focused attention to questions of balance, roles, and\\n the quality of the working relationship between members and chairmen. In most of\\n the agencies, the formal delineations of authority are imprecise. Even when defini-\\n tion has been attempted, substantial gray areas have been left.278\\n When Congress removed the ICC from the Interior Department in 1889,\\n it gave the Commission as an institution substantive and organizational\\n Level III, as are non-Chairman members of the NRC, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety\\n Board, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. See 5 U.S.C. § 5314 (1994 & Supp.\\n IV 1998). The rate of pay for Executive Level III is $123,100. See Exec. Order No. 13,033,\\n 3 C.F.R. 245 (1996), reprinted in 5 U.S.C. § 5332, at 252. The Chairmen of the Federal La-\\n bor Relations Authority and the Board of Veterans\\' Appeals, and the non-Chairmen mem-\\n bers of most multi-member commissions are paid at Executive Level IV. See 5 U.S.C. §\\n 5315 (1994 & Supp. IV 1998). The rate of pay for Executive Level IV is $115,700. See\\n Exec. Order No. 13,033, 3 C.F.R. 245 (1996), reprinted in 5 U.S.C. § 5332, at 252. The\\n statute governing the Chemical Safety Board gives the President the power to establish pay\\n categories for all members. 5 U.S.C. § 5317 (1994).

Indeed,\\n the chairman was referred to only once in the statute: expenses were to be\\n paid upon the presentation of itemized vouchers approved by the chair-\\n man.282 Other multi-member agencies were modeled on the structure of the\\n icc.283\\n Over time, both the President and Congress came to recognize that the\\n day-to-day administration of an agency cannot be exercised collectively.\\n Multi-member institutions need some centralized administration. In 1949,\\n the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Govern-\\n ment (Hoover Commission) recommended that all administrative responsi-\\n bility at multi-member agencies be vested in the chairman of the agency.284\\n During the 1950s and 1960s, Presidents Truman and Kennedy, responding\\n to that recommendation, presented several reorganization plans to Congress\\n designed to transfer from the agency to its chairman the power of day-to-\\n day agency administration. 25 Since then, even non-chairmen members of\\n multi-member agencies have come to accept the necessity of some central-\\n ized administration.86\\n As our surveyed of some thirty federal multi-member agencies sug-\\n gests,287 all of the reorganization statutes and their progeny fundamentally\\n 279.

But each statute uses its own form of words that\\n can create slightly different demarcations of responsibility. Frequently,\\n Congress simply copies from one statute to another, or amalgamates por-\\n tions of more than one statute into the new statute. Statutory language is\\n often ambiguous, and even relatively detailed statutes rarely fill in all of the\\n fine points of the agency\\'s organization and operation.\\n The typical reorganization plan of the 1950s and 1960s contained the\\n following language:\\n There are hereby transferred from the... Commission... to the Chairman of the\\n Commission ... the executive and administrative functions of the Commission, in-\\n cluding functions of the Commission with respect to (1) the appointment and supervi-\\n sion of personnel employed under the Commission, (2) the distribution of business\\n among such personnel and among administrative units of the Commission, and (3)\\n the use and expenditures of funds.288\\n Use of the term \"including\" before the specific enumeration of the tril-\\n ogy of conventional executive or administrative functions indicates that ap-\\n pointment and supervision of staff, the distribution of the agency\\'s work,\\n and the use and expenditure of funds were generally regarded as executive\\n or administrative functions belonging to the chairman. But the full range of\\n executive or administrative powers, and the relationship between admini-\\n stration and substance, were undefined. The Hoover Commission could do\\n no better than observe that \"[p]urely executive duties [are] those that can be\\n performed far better by a single administrative official.289\\n Importantly, the chairman\\'s administrative and executive powers were\\n rarely unfettered. The typical reorganization plan limited the chairman\\'s\\n executive and administrative powers in four key respects:\\n (1) In carrying out any of his functions under the provisions of this section the\\n Chairman shall be governed by general policies of the Commission and by such\\n regulatory decisions, findings, and determinations as the Commission may by law be\\n authorized to make.\\n (2) The appointment by the Chairman of the heads of major administrative units\\n under the Commission shall be subject to the approval of the Commission.\\n (3) Personnel employed regularly and full time in the immediate offices of members\\n of the Commission other than the Chairman shall not be affected by the provisions of\\n this reorganization plan.\\n 288.

It plainly left to each member selection and su-\\n pervision of staff in his or her own office. Moreover, it required that, in\\n exercising administrative powers, a chairman had to do so in accordance\\n with the agency\\'s overall policy direction-whatever that meant. And it\\n gave the agency as a whole a role to play with respect to certain core re-\\n sponsibilities-such as overall approval of key staff appointments, and the\\n budget-that were likely to affect the agency\\'s substantive functions or\\n mission. Professor Welborn observed in his study of multi-member agen-\\n cies: \"Although some differences are specified in the prerogatives of\\n chairmen and the membership, ultimate formal responsibility for regulatory\\n policy development and implementation is vested in... [the agency] to be\\n exercised in a collegial, shared manner.\"292\\n The most significant publicly available examinations of the respective\\n responsibilities of the chairman of a multi-member agency and the agency\\n as a whole are (1) a 1974 opinion of the Comptroller General, and an\\n amendment to it issued four months later, dealing with the EEOC;293 (2) a\\n memorandum prepared by the Office of General Counsel of the Chemical\\n Safety Board (CSB) outlining the respective roles of the chairman and the\\n 290.

The three commissioners\\n sought out the Comptroller General\\'s advice on the ground that the issue involved the ex-\\n penditure of appropriated funds; the three commissioners also asked, more generally, that\\n the Comptroller General address the respective roles and responsibilities of the Chairman\\n vis-A-vis the Commission as a body.

One group in-\\n cludes the substantive aspect of regulation-that is, the determination of policies, the\\n formulation and issuance of rules, and the adjudication of cases. All these functions\\n are left in the board or commission as a whole. The other group of functions com-\\n prises the day-to-day direction and internal administration of the complex staff or-\\n ganizations which the commissions require. These responsibilities are transferred to\\n the chairman of the agencies, to be discharged in accordance with policies which the\\n commissions may establish.\\'O\\n There are nonetheless some administrative functions with which the\\n agency as a whole may not interfere. However, the Comptroller General\\n indicated that \"where disputes arise as to what matters are procedural or\\n administrative and what are substantive, the full commission should have\\n the final say.\\'302 The Office of Legal Counsel endorses this principle as\\n well.3°3\\n Agency statutes are different and each is, to some extent, sui generis.\\n Statutory deviation from the model of the reorganization plans ordinarily\\n occurs when specific institutional issues are brought to Congress\\' attention,\\n or are for some reason a matter of congressional (or, more likely, congres-\\n sional staff) interest or concern.

Taken together\\n with those provisions that appear to accord the agency as a whole greater\\n than usual administrative authority, the inclusion of these specific provi-\\n sions leads to the presumption that Congress intended to leave no doubt as\\n to the distinct responsibilities of the agency and the chairman.31\\'\\n Many statutes are far less detailed regarding the relationship between the\\n chairman and the agency as a whole. They simply give the chairman unde-\\n fined administrative and executive powers. For example, the statute gov-\\n erning the Federal Reserve Board provides that, \"[t]he Chairman of the\\n Board, subject to its supervision, shall be its active executive officer.\"312\\n The National Labor Relations Board\\'s statute provides simply that the\\n President shall designate one member to serve as chairman, but it otherwise\\n has no provisions relating to the chairman\\'s duties.313 As a practical mat-\\n ter, key decisions at both agencies are made collegially.314\\n The chairman\\'s clearest area of responsibility is the day-to-day admini-\\n stration of the agency. The prototype statute expressly gives the chairman\\n the right to distribute business among agency personnel and administrative\\n units within the agency.15 No other approach is genuinely workable.

Yet the OSHRC statute states that \"[tihe Chairman shall be responsible on behalf of\\n the Commission for the administrative operations of the Commission and shall appoint such\\n administrative law judges and other employees as he deems necessary to assist in the per-\\n formance of the Commission\\'s functions and to fix their compensation.\" 29 U.S.C. § 661(e)\\n (1994).

For example, some statutes make no explicit provision for a Vice Chairman or\\n some other person or persons to temporarily run the agency in the event of the absence or\\n disability of the Chairman. However, it would be irresponsible for an agency to allow itself\\n simply to drift if critical administrative functions needed to be performed. The FCC has\\n filled this statutory void by providing that it will temporarily designate one of its members\\n to serve as Chairman in the absence of the appointed Chairman. See 47 C.F.R. § 0.3(b)\\n (1999). The agency presumably relies on its statutory power to \"perform any and all acts,\\n make such rules and regulations, and issue such orders ... as may be necessary in the exe-\\n cution of its functions.\" 47 U.S.C. § 154(i) (1994). However, even agencies with more\\n limited statutory authority should have ample power to designate one of its members to per-\\n form functions that are essential to the continued operation of the agency. The Supreme\\n Court has traditionally allowed agencies considerable procedural discretion, observing that\\n agencies \"should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of\\n inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.\" Vermont Yan-\\n kee Nuclear Power Corp. v.

The OLC\\'s general observations on the respective\\n roles of the chairman and the agency as a whole are worth setting out in\\n some detail:\\n [U]nder the Act and general principles governing the operations of boards, the day-\\n to-day administration of Board matters and execution of Board policies are the re-\\n sponsibilities of the chairperson, subject to Board oversight, while substantive poli-\\n cymaking and regulatory authority is vested in the Board as a whole. In disputes over\\n the allocation of authority in specific instances, the Board\\'s decision controls, as long\\n as it is not arbitrary or unreasonable....\\n [Tihe Act provides that the chairperson \"shall be the Chief Executive Officer of the\\n Board and shall exercise the executive and administrative functions of the Board.\" ...\\n [Tihe terms [\"Chief Executive Officer\" and \"executive and administrative functions\"]\\n ... provide some general guidance on the proper division of authority between the\\n chairperson and the Board as a whole. ...

The OLC, more protective of the President\\'s prerogatives, advised\\n the Federal Reserve Board that its Vice Chairman could not simply assume the duties of the\\n Chairman when a vacancy occurred because the Vice Chairman had express statutory power\\n only to \"preside\" at Board meetings in the absence of the Chairman. The OLC acknowl-\\n edged that a contrary argument could be made and noted that the Federal Reserve Board\\n had, in the past, actually elected one of its members to serve as Chairman pro tempore.\\n Nonetheless, the OLC asserted that, absent an express statutorily prescribed mechanism for\\n filling vacancies, the President may designate one of the Board members to serve as acting\\n Chairman.

These could in-\\n clude rules bearing on matters of internal Board governance ... as well as rules gov-\\n erning the conduct of Board business with the public .... To the extent the Board\\n establishes such rules, the chairperson, as the Board\\'s administrative and executive\\n officer, must put them into practice....\\n [T]his does not mean that the Board, exercising its oversight authority and its powers\\n to make substantive decisions ... may or should attempt to address itself to the pleth-\\n ora of minute administrative problems bound up with the operation of a complex or-\\n ganization. Some degree of managerial discretion is inherent in the concept of an ex-\\n ecutive or administrative office, and the statutory assignment of the Board\\'s\\n executive and administrative functions to the chairperson necessarily vests the chair-\\n person with a degree of managerial autonomy on which the Board, in the proper ex-\\n ercise of its powers, cannot trench .... At the same time ... any number of Board ac-\\n tivities or day-to-day aspects of Board business, while at least in part administrative\\n and even seemingly mundane, may involve or affect the board\\'s duties and functions\\n in ways that are of legitimate concern to the board as a whole. Where that is the case,\\n it is the prerogative of the Board to pass upon such issues in ways appropriate to its\\n function as a policymaking and rule-setting body.328\\n It must be noted that an agency\\'s statute alone rarely tells the complete\\n story of agency operation. Because most statutes are incomplete or am-\\n biguous and there is no official forum (such as a court) for regular resolu-\\n tion of intra-agency management questions, agency chairmen may, and at\\n certain times do, assert administrative prerogatives. Former FTC Chairman\\n Miles Kirkpatrick observed:\\n I should make it clear that in the management of the Commission\\'s day-to-day af-\\n fairs, there are no collegial decisions. Management of the Commission, save for the\\n appointment of the top policy making positions and policy decisions having to do\\n with the allocation of major resources, is placed squarely in the Chairman.

Even at the FCC, where the Chairman\\'s powers are\\n somewhat circumscribed by statute, former FCC member Glen Robinson has noted: \"From\\n personal experience I can report that the FCC\\'s Chairman and a handful of staff-usually\\n selected by the chair-can and usually do exercise nearly total control over that agency\\'s\\n basic policy agenda.\" Glen 0. Robinson, Independent Agencies: Form and Substance in\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n 1176\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n Professor Welborn also suggests that chairmen have a relatively greater\\n influence than their colleagues do on substantive matters. He found that\\n agency chairmen dissent with far less frequency than their colleagues in\\n substantive, collegial decisions.330  As a result, decisionmaking even at\\n multi-member agencies is \"relatively centralized\" and \"independent action\\n at lower levels on critical matters is limited.\",331 A more recent study by\\n Professors Derthick and Quirk of three multi-member agencies (Civil\\n Aeronautics Board, ICC, FCC) during the deregulatory period from 1975-\\n 1980 reached much the same conclusions.332 They observed:\\n Commission members tended in general to defer to the chairman. The formal execu-\\n tive powers that all of the chairmen possessed gave them a great advantage over\\n commission members .... In truth, commission members had very little to do and\\n few resources with which to do it....\\n Being the president\\'s choice also helped the chairmen .... This created some pre-\\n sumption that the chairman was pursuing policies that were also the president\\'s poli-\\n cies and that he was therefore entitled to support from those commission members\\n who were of the same political party as the president and the chairman.333\\n As a practical matter, the combination of political prestige and manage-\\n rial authority accord some agency chairmen the power to dominate and\\n Executive Prerogative, 1988 DUKE L.J. 238, 245 n.24.

Indeed, this is also the practice at the NTSB. However,\\n the OLC makes clear that the retention of significant authority in a Chairman \"is a matter of\\n the development, through collegial practice and over time, of the [agency\\'s] own internal\\n policies concerning delegation of authority to the ... chairperson, the [agency\\'s] acquies-\\n cence in the chairperson\\'s assertion of authority over certain substantive areas, and the gen-\\n eral evolution of the [agency\\'s] current allocation of responsibilities.\" OLC 2000 Opinion,\\n supra note 295, at 7.

See WELBORN, supra note 278, at 109 (stating that based on a survey of reported\\n decisions since 1961, \"[w]ith only a few exceptions, the number of times chairmen dissent\\n during their tenure can be counted on the fingers of one hand.\").\\n 33 I. ld. at 20.

He participated in a meeting at which\\n Kahn\\'s executive director indicated that the Chairman wanted the application of Midway\\n Airlines, a new entrant, to be considered by the Board within a year. The only way to meet\\n Kahn\\'s deadline was to eliminate the preparation of an initial decision by the presiding ALJ\\n and have the Board decide the case itself, as an agency is authorized to do in initial licensing\\n cases under 5 U.S.C. § 557(b)(1) of the APA. So the staff developed a schedule that had the\\n ALJ preside at the hearing but simply certify the record to the Board for decision. The gen-\\n eral counsel\\'s office worked closely with Kahn and his colleagues in reviewing the evidence\\n and drafting an opinion, and the Board issued its decision (technically a \"tentative deci-\\n sion\") within a year as Kahn had directed. Chicago-Midway Low-Fare Route Proceeding,\\n \\n 1178\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n A chairman\\'s assertion of power can be thwarted by colleagues. A 1999\\n turf battle between the Chairman of the Chemical Safety and Hazard In-\\n vestigation Board (CSB) and his fellow members demonstrates the inade-\\n quacy of law and the ascendancy of political will in the resolution of inter-\\n nal agency conflicts. The CSB\\'s statute and legislative history, not\\n uncharacteristically, fail to delineate precisely the respective roles of the\\n chairman, as the agency\\'s chief administrative officer, and his colleagues,\\n in directing the agency\\'s overall operation. At long-established agencies,\\n this relationship has been worked out over time. But the CSB was brand\\n new, with four newly appointed members.\\n None of the four board members were lawyers. Three of them were dis-\\n tressed that the chairman and a newly appointed chief operating officer\\n simply ran the agency without consultation.338  The three asked the agency\\n general counsel to provide guidance as to the respective responsibilities of\\n the chairman and the board as a whole. He opined that the chairman was in\\n day-to-day administrative control of the agency, with authority, for exam-\\n ple, to assign work to and supervise the staff, but he also said that the board\\n had statutory power to play some admittedly undefined role in the overall\\n administration of the agency, such as approval of senior staff appointments\\n and the agency\\'s annual budget.339 With no express statutory guidance on\\n any particular division of responsibility, the general counsel proposed that\\n the board members jointly agree on a modus vivendi.340 The chairman de-\\n 78 C.A.B. 454 (1978). See also Mark E. Budnitz, The FTC\\'s Consumer Protection Pro-\\n gram During the Miller Years: Lessons for Administrative Agency Structure and Operation,\\n 46 CATE. U. L. REv. 371, 413-14 (1997). Budnitz observes that the approval process for\\n many FTC rules in the pipeline but not promulgated became \"stalled\" when James Miller\\n became the FTC Chairman. Nonetheless, some rules went forward. The FTC unanimously\\n enacted a credit practices rule and promulgated a funeral industry practices regulation over\\n Miller\\'s opposition. See id. at 421-24. Budnitz notes that Chairman Miller did not termi-\\n nate any rulemaking proceedings, thus leaving open the possibility that a new Chairman\\n might have resumed them. As of the 1997 date of the article, that had not happened. See id.\\n at 436-37. The FTC\\'s adjudicatory caseload also decreased during the Miller administra-\\n tion. See id. at 391.\\n 338. Among other things, the Chairman unilaterally decided that the Board would not\\n undertake any new investigations. See Guy Gugliotta, Chemical Hazards Board and Chief\\n a Volatile Mix, WASH.

Collegial Decisionmaking\\n When the chairman of the NLRB was about to leave his post in the\\n summer of 1998, he complained about the inability of the board to issue\\n key decisions, noting that even a single member could hold them       up.348\\n The problem was one of collegiality and custom (or inability to muster a\\n majority) rather than legality.349\\n Where circumstances require, a majority of a multi-member agency gen-\\n erally can issue a decision without awaiting preparation of any dissenting\\n or other separate statements. The courts use this technique, usually with\\n the consent of the dissenting members,350 but it can also be done over the\\n objection of a dissenting colleague.351 Although the technique can com-\\n 346.

At the SEC, Chairman William Casey in 1972 sepa-\\n rated the Enforcement Division from the Division of Market Regulation. In the opinion of\\n one former commissioner, this reorganization, coupled with key appointments to the Com-\\n mission and its senior staff, made the Division of Enforcement staff the dominant player in\\n setting the Commission\\'s agenda. The dynamic changed to some extent when Chairman\\n Harold Williams gave the Office of General Counsel a role to play in analyzing Enforce-\\n ment Division recommendations. See Roberta S.

Indeed, even the\\n NLRB has such a procedure.52 It just does not seem to use it.353\\n B. Quorum and Voting Requirements\\n Agency quorum and voting requirements are established by statute or, in\\n the absence of a statutory provision, by agency regulation or tradition. The\\n National Labor Relations Act contains an example of the traditional statu-\\n tory provision. It provides simply that three of the NLRB\\'s five statutory\\n 354\\n members constitute a quorum.\\n Obviously, agencies must follow explicit statutory quorum or voting re-\\n quirements.355 Absent a statutory provision, however, most multi-member\\n federal agencies follow the common law \"majority of the quorum\" rule,\\n which means that a quorum is needed before the agency may act, but only a\\n majority of the quorum is needed for action once a quorum is constituted.\\n Thus, if an agency\\'s enabling legislation provides that it has five members\\n 352. See infra Appendix (NLRB).\\n 353. In a highly unusual case, certain private parties sued the three-member Occupa-\\n tional Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) to compel its secretary to release a\\n decision that had been signed by two members, one of whom had left the agency before the\\n third member (the Chairman) had completed his dissenting statement. The remaining mem-\\n ber of the majority joined in the lawsuit. In due course, following completion of the Chair-\\n man\\'s dissenting statement, the agency released the \"2-1\" decision and the court dismissed\\n the case as moot. See Arcadian Corp., 17 O.Sh. Cas. (BNA) 1345 (Apr. 27, 1995) (Weis-\\n berg, Chairman, dissenting), dismissed as moot, In re Arcadian Corp., 17 O.S.H. (BNA)\\n 1406 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 4, 1995).\\n 354. See 29 U.S.C. § 153(b) (1994).\\n 355. For example, the FEC statute requires four affirmative votes out of six commis-\\n sioners before the agency may act; a vote of 3-2, with one abstention, is insufficient. See 2\\n U.S.C. § 437c(c) (1994). In one case, the FEC was unable to muster the necessary four\\n votes, and thus dismissed a complaint without opinion notwithstanding a recommendation\\n by its general counsel, based on FEC precedent, that the complaint be pursued. The D.C.\\n Circuit held that the FEC was required to explain its reasons for dismissal so that the court\\n could evaluate them. Democratic Congressional Campaign Comm. v. FEC, 831 F.2d 1131,\\n 1132 (D.C. Cir. 1987). An agency member who concurs separately but articulates what a\\n court decides is an impermissible basis for his or her decision can doom an agency\\'s deci-\\n sion. Where four of five members of the NLRB participated in a case-two joined in a plu-\\n rality opinion, one concurred separately, and one dissented-the court reversed the decision\\n because it found that the concurring opinion had relied on an impermissible construction of\\n the statute. The court found it unnecessary to examine the plurality opinion because the\\n Board, as a whole, had failed to articulate a proper basis for resolving the case. Oil, Chem.\\n & Atomic Workers Int\\'l Union, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 46 F.3d 82, 88 (D.C. Cir. 1995).\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n 1182\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n and that three members shall constitute a quorum, the agency may take ac-\\n tion by a 2-1 vote.356 It is immaterial that only a minority of the agency\\'s\\n total membership participates or that any statutorily intended balance is dis-\\n rupted.357 To be counted as part of a quorum, agency members need not\\n offer their views on the merits of a proceeding.358 As the New Jersey Su-\\n preme Court observed in connection with a multi-member state agency:\\n Insofar as the presence of a legal quorum is in issue, all that matters is whether the\\n physically present commissioners participated in agency deliberations and took pur-\\n poseful action by joining, concurring in, dissenting from, or even abstaining from the\\n final decision.359\\n Absent statutory requirements, a multi-member agency may, within rea-\\n son, use its other statutory powers to determine how its quorum require-\\n ments will be satisfied. For example, the enabling statutes for the Securi-\\n ties and Exchange Commission (SEC) do not have explicit quorum\\n requirements. Those statutes nonetheless authorize the agency to \"make\\n such rules and regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to implement\\n the provisions of this chapter for which they are responsible or for the exe-\\n cution of the functions vested in them by this chapter .... 360\\n In 1995, the SEC adopted a regulation that provides that three members\\n constitute a quorum unless the number of members in office is fewer than\\n three, in which case the quorum consists of the number of members actu-\\n ally in office.361 The regulation further provides that if on any matter of\\n business, the number of members in office minus the number of members\\n who are disqualified to consider the matter is two, then those two members\\n constitute a quorum for purposes of that specific matter.

Commodity Futures Trading Comm\\'n, 980 F.2d 1289, 1293-94 (9th Cir.\\n 1992) (stating that agency member who merely concurred in the result held to have partici-\\n pated in the decision for quorum purposes).\\n 359.

Decisions by numerous courts and agencies establish that an agency\\n member who did not participate at the agency\\'s oral argument may nonetheless familiarize\\n himself or herself with the record and participate in the decision. See, e.g., Porter &\\n Dietsch, Inc. v. FTC, 605 F.2d 294, 298-99 (7th Cir. 1979) (citing Gearhart & Otis, Inc. v.\\n SEC, 348 F.2d 798, 802 (D.C.

A similar\\n provision has been incorporated into many subsequent statutes.    Even\\n where it has not, the courts have generally reached the same result as a\\n matter of sensible administration.364\\n Less than a quorum of the agency may ordinarily grant discretionary re-\\n view of an administrative law judge\\'s decision. A typical provision is that\\n of the five-member Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission,\\n which requires only two votes to take review. 365   Likewise, the five-\\n member Securities and Exchange Commission grants review on request of\\n only one of its members.366\\n Depending on the language of an agency\\'s enabling statute, there may be\\n limited circumstances where it can even operate without a statutory quo-\\n rum. In Railroad Yardmasters of America v. Harris, the court decided\\n whether the National Mediation Board violated its quorum requirement.367\\n According to statutory provisions, the National Mediation Board has\\n authority to delegate functions to individual members.368 In Harris, one\\n seat on the Board was vacant and another seat was soon to be vacated.369\\n On the eve of the resignation of the second Board member, the two mem-\\n 362.

The D.C.\\n Circuit held the arrangement was valid because it prevented the three-\\n member Board from complete disability due to the two vacancies.37\\n Similar to the National Mediation Board\\'s provision, the statute that con-\\n trols the operations of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Com-\\n mission provides that an administrative law judge\\'s decision goes into ef-\\n fect \"unless any Commission member has directed that such [decision]\\n shall be reviewed by the Commission.,371 Thus, an ALJ\\'s decisions go into\\n effect if no member directs review, even if the Commission has no mem-\\n bers!\\n Whether a tie vote constitutes agency action depends on the agency\\'s\\n statutes and regulations, which vary among agencies. Agency and court\\n interpretations reflect an experiential linkage between procedure and sub-\\n stance. Generally speaking, where affirmative agency action is required, a\\n tie vote does not represent agency action because a majority of the agency\\n has failed to agree on a decision.372 Following this approach, the rules of\\n the SEC expressly provide that an initial decision of one of the agency\\'s\\n ALJs has no effect if a majority of the Commission cannot agree to a dis-\\n position on the merits of a decision that is under its review.373 In contrast,\\n when the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission divides\\n equally, two for affirmance and two for reversal, the ALJ\\'s decision is af-\\n firmed.374 The difference in approach may be explained by the fact that the\\n FMSHRC\\'s major responsibility is dispute-resolution while the SEC per-\\n ceives its adjudicatory role to be part of its broader policy-making respon-\\n sibilities.\\n 370.

With respect to the three-member Occupational Safety\\n and Health Review Commission that has frequently operated with only two\\n members (and occasionally with only one), some courts have concluded\\n that at least those decisions by an equally-divided agency (1-1) purportedly\\n \"affirming\" an AU\\'s decision constitute final, judicially reviewable agency\\n action,37 while other courts have reached the opposite result.376 Some stat-\\n utes provide that a divided vote on reconsideration brings an agency action\\n to an end by leaving the original decision in place.377 In common sense\\n fashion, numerous agencies have adopted the same approach in practice,\\n which has been approved by the courts.378\\n A practical question that arises from time to time, but which has re-\\n ceived little attention, is whether members who are disqualified or have re-\\n cused themselves voluntarily from participation in a matter may, nonethe-\\n less, constitute part of a quorum. Members who are disqualified from\\n participation because of some genuine conflict of interest probably cannot\\n be included in the quorum. The participation rights of a member who vol-\\n untarily recuses himself or herself likely depends on the circumstances and\\n terms of the recusal.\\n As best we can tell, there is no direct precedent involving the federal\\n multi-member agencies. However, the Third Circuit confronted the issue\\n in a case involving a local draft board.379 The court determined that par-\\n ticipation by a disqualified member, even to constitute a quorum, would\\n conflict with the duty to act impartially.380 Acknowledging that there is a\\n split of opinion on the issue, the court relied on cases involving corporate\\n boards of directors, and suggested that a strict rule was required when gov-\\n ernmental agencies acted in order to protect the due process rights of indi-\\n 375.

Beatrice Pocahontas Coal Co., 67 F.3d 517, 522 n.8 (4th Cir. 1995)\\n (stating that decision by equally divided agency, like similar court decision, is \"affirmance-\\n by-necessity\").\\n 376.

A member who is disqualified from participating in a particular\\n matter may not be counted in determining the presence of a legal quorum.383\\n Nevertheless, agencies have been advised by courts to attempt to reach a\\n final decision whenever possible.384 Where the recusal or disqualification\\n of individuals would prevent the body from acting, and there is no legally\\n available substitute decisionmaker, courts have approved the participation\\n of individuals who may be \"biased\" as a matter of law under a \"rule of ne-\\n cessity.\"  Such cases include United States v. Will,385 where the Supreme\\n Court decided an issue involving pay raises for all federal judges even\\n though the case affected their salaries, and FTC v.

Two Nuclear Regulatory Commission decisions reflect that\\n agency\\'s effort to avoid incapacity as a result of recusals. During the course of their Senate\\n confirmation hearings, two prospective NRC commissioners agreed to limit their participa-\\n tion in a particular license proceeding then pending before the agency, but had differing un-\\n derstandings with the Senate committee regarding the extent of possible participation. In\\n Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, 32 N.R.C. 218, 223 (1990), with one vacancy on its\\n five-member Commission, the NRC denied a motion to reopen the case. This denial indi-\\n cated that two commissioners voted in favor of the result, one commissioner did not partici-\\n pate, and the fourth abstained. See id at 223. Under established NRC procedure, the quo-\\n rum count included the abstaining commissioner but not the non-participant. Therefore, the\\n agency was able to act with only a 2-0 vote.

Bias\\n The definitions of bias are now reasonably well established and attempt\\n to take into account two critical distinctions between agencies and courts.391\\n First, agencies undertake legislative, executive and quasi-judicial functions\\n simultaneously. If an administrative system is to function without a dupli-\\n cation of personnel or a cloning of politically accountable officials, the\\n mere performance of all three functions by agency members should not,\\n and does not, standing alone, violate due process. 392 Second, agencies are\\n ing the agency\\'s ability to defer the issue until such time as a proper quorum to consider the\\n merits was available. See id. at 1331. Finally, in Kellogg Co., the FTC decided that a\\n Commissioner\\'s voluntary recusal from one phase of a proceeding did not necessarily re-\\n quire his recusal from another, unrelated phase of the proceeding. See Kellogg Co., 97\\n F.T.C. 159, 161-62 (1981).\\n 388. If disqualification is requested by a party to an agency adjudication, \"the agency\\n shall determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the case.\" APA § 7(a), 5\\n U.S.C. § 556(b) (1994). The term \"presiding or participating employee\" refers to those in-\\n dividuals who preside at the reception of evidence, such as administrative law judges.\\n 389. The provision on disqualification was contained in original section 7 of the APA,\\n which deals with the hearing process. See § 7(a), 5 U.S.C. § 556(b); see also UNITED\\n STATES DEP\\'T OF JUSTICE, ATTORNEY GENERAL\\'S MANUAL ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE\\n PROCEDURE ACT 71-74 (1947).

They have a responsibility for deciding indi-\\n vidual cases within a broad statutory and policy context. Agency members\\n frequently seek agency positions (or are selected for them) because they are\\n experts in the field or hold views on how the agency\\'s statutory responsi-\\n bilities should be administered. The public benefits when those views are\\n known rather than concealed. So an underlying philosophy of regulation,\\n even publicly articulated, does not ordinarily rise to a level of bias that\\n would violate due process principles.393 Indeed, in an oft-quoted phrase,\\n the Seventh Circuit has observed that a total absence of preconceptions\\n \"would be evidence of a lack of qualification[s] not lack of bias.\"394 Pro-\\n fessors Gellhorn and Levin have pithily stated, \"[T]he law has generally\\n demonstrated a keen awareness that an agency decisionmaker should be\\n open minded, but not empty headed.395\\n The courts have adapted concepts of bias to the administrative arena.\\n When an agency is engaged in formal adjudication, most closely resem-\\n bling dispute resolution as practiced by judges, the courts have created a\\n definition of bias closely resembling that applicable to judges. As a general\\n matter, a federal judge must disqualify himself: \"in any proceeding in\\n which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned;\" where he has a\\n \"personal prejudice concerning a party, or [has] personal knowledge of dis-\\n puted facts;\" or has an interest \"that could be substantially affected by the\\n outcome of the proceeding.\"396 The classic disqualification standard appli-\\n cable in formal administrative adjudications was set forth in Cinderella Ca-\\n reer and Finishing Schools, Inc. v.

SEC, 267 F.2d\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 1189\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n Allegations of bias in adjudicatory proceedings principally arise in two\\n ways. First, an agency member may have pre-existing views on issues he\\n or she is supposed to determine from the facts presented in the proceeding.\\n Typically, such views are revealed when the agency member speaks out\\n forcefully on issues or matters pending before the agency. In Cinderella,\\n FTC Chairman Dixon\\'s speech to the National Congress of Petroleum Re-\\n tailers used one of Cinderella\\'s advertising claims to illustrate a case of\\n possible fraud.398 The court ruled that Chairman Dixon was disqualified\\n because he had prejudged, or at least appeared to have prejudged, specific\\n facts at issue in an adjudication still pending before him.399 However, the\\n mere exposure to facts as part of an agency member\\'s official duties, apart\\n from adjudication, will not require disqualification.400 Similarly, having a\\n preconceived position concerning legal or policy issues, which an agency\\n member has acquired while carrying out other duties, will not ordinarily\\n result in disqualification.40\\'\\n Second, an agency member may have had some association with a case\\n he or she is later called upon to decide. For example, in Trans World Air-\\n lines, Inc. v. CAB,402 a member of the agency was prohibited from partici-\\n pating in a decision involving the determination of an airline\\'s mail pay\\n where he had earlier signed a brief in the case as solicitor for the Post Of-\\n fice Department.403 It is important to note that the prior contact need not\\n have been as a representative of a party. In American Cyanamid Co. v.\\n FTC,404 the agency chairman was barred from participating in a case be-\\n cause he had previously been counsel to a congressional committee, and\\n because he had played an active role in investigating some of the same is-\\n sues while a congressional staff member.405\\n Similarly, an agency member may be seen as having some personal, or-\\n dinarily pecuniary, stake in the outcome of the proceeding. In such cir-\\n cumstances, disqualification is not merely required in the interest of fair-\\n ness,406 but participation in the case may constitute a criminal offense or\\n 461, 469 (2d Cir. 1959)).\\n 398.

See Cement Inst., 333 U.S. at 701 (stating that information acquired through an ex\\n parte investigation did not automatically result in bias).\\n 402. 254 F.2d 90 (D.C. Cir. 1958).\\n 403.

The rigorous\\n screening process conducted by the White House Counsel\\'s office, the\\n agency\\'s ethics officer, and the Office of Government Ethics ensures that\\n any agency official who is nominated by the President will not derive per-\\n sonal gain from the position.48\\n The courts have been unwilling to impose the strict Cinderella standard\\n when agencies are engaged in informal rule-making proceedings of a pol-\\n 409\\n icy nature.    In such cases, the court will disqualify an agency decision-\\n Board that was deemed to be biased and therefore unable to fairly adjudicate issues before\\n it).\\n 407. See 18 U.S.C. § 208 (199) (forbidding government employees from engaging in\\n acts affecting personal financial interest, otherwise he will be subject to penalties). The\\n Federal criminal conflict of interest laws prohibit all federal employees from, among other\\n things, participating personally and substantially in matters in which the employee or a\\n member or his or her family has a financial interest, including an interest in prospective em-\\n ployment. See id. Agency members, as well as their staffs, are prohibited from participat-\\n ing in certain cases by the government-wide provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of\\n 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-521, 92 Stat. 1824 (codified as amended in 5 U.S.C. app. at 1400\\n (1994)), and related statutes, including those sections dealing with conflicts of interest and\\n impartiality. Many agency statutes also contain additional conflict-of-interest provisions\\n that prohibit both agency members and staff from participating in proceedings in which their\\n impartiality may be suspect.\\n 408. See Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Political Control Versus Impermissible Bias in Agency\\n Decisionmaking: Lessons from Chevron and Mistretta, 57 U. CHi. L. REv. 481, 488 (1990).\\n In a thorough discussion of the tension between responsibility for agency action by politi-\\n cally accountable officials, and impermissible bias, Professor Pierce argues that agency de-\\n cisionmakers should never be disqualified from participating in rule-making proceedings\\n simply because they express strong views on the policy issues to be resolved. See id. at 489.\\n For example, in Association of Nat\\'l Advertisers v. FTC, FTC Chairman Pertschuk spoke\\n out strongly and often about the evils of certain children\\'s advertising, and even committed\\n to ending the practice, but was not disqualified. 627 F.2d 1151, 1189-90 (D.C. Cir. 1979)\\n (MacKinnon, J., concurring and dissenting). Professor Pierce contends that the articulation\\n of an agency official\\'s views, even with regard to matters at issue in adjudications, has a\\n salutary effect. It helps the regulated sector understand the agency\\'s policies so that they\\n can shape their conduct accordingly. See Pierce, supra. Pierce perceives little harm in the\\n Cinderella approach since agency officials use methods of expressing their policy views\\n other than citing to pending adjudications. See id. at 494-95; see also Recommendation 80-\\n 4 of the Administrative Conference of the United States, Decisional Officials\\' Participation\\n in Rulemaking Proceedings, 45 Fed. Reg. 46,777 (1980) (reporting that disqualification for\\n prejudgment in rulemaking should be limited to prejudgments of material \"adjudicative\" or\\n \"specific\" facts where the agency\\'s factual determination is based on evidentiary record).\\n 409. See Association of Nat \\'l Advertisers, 627 F.2d at 1168-69 (\"The Cinderella view of\\n a natural and detached adjudicator is simply an inapposite role model for an administrator\\n who must translate broad statutory commands into concrete social policies.\") But see Ce-\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 1191\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n maker only when there has been a clear and convincing showing that the\\n agency member has an unalterably closed mind on matters critical to the\\n disposition of the proceeding.41°\\n Judge MacKinnon has argued that the unalterably closed mind assump-\\n tion would be \"practically impossible to prove,\"41\\' and he appears to have\\n been correct.412\\n 2. Theory of Political Contacts and Independence\\n Agency members can especially be influenced by members of Congress\\n or Administration officials, including the President, who may attempt to\\n sway the agency\\'s decision, either through the public submission of views\\n or via some type of off-the-record contact. Up to a point, efforts to influ-\\n ence or superintend agency activity is a recognized part of the oversight\\n process by elected officials.13 Public pronouncements, including speeches\\n in Congress or the public filing of documents with the agency, have not\\n posed legal problems. Communications implicate considerations of fair-\\n ness in two circumstances. First, if political involvement is off-the-record,\\n i.e., it involves communications with the agency not known to the partici-\\n pants in the proceeding or subject to effective rebuttal, it plainly endangers\\n ment Inst., 333 U.S. at 701 (applying \"irrevocably closed mind\" standard). Although the\\n Supreme Court has never overruled Cement Institute with respect to this standard, it is no\\n longer followed. See Bernard Schwartz, Bias in Webster and Bias in Administrative Law-\\n The Recent Jurisprudence, 30 TULSA L.J. 461, 479-82 (1995).\\n 410. See Association of Nat\\'l Advertisers, 627 F.2d at 1154 (holding Cinderella standard\\n inapplicable).\\n 411. Id. at 1181 (MacKinnon, J., concurring and dissenting).\\n 412. See 3 KENNETH CULP DAVIS, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW TREATISE 374-75 (2d ed. 1980)\\n (agreeing that closed mind standard is impossible to prove). But see Northwestern Bell Tel.\\n Co. v. Stofferhahn, 461 N.W.2d 129, 134-35 (S.D. 1990) (applying \"unalterably closed\\n mind test\" to disqualify a state regulatory commissioner who opposed deregulation from\\n participating in any proceeding involving issues of \"deregulation, classification, or competi-\\n tive status determination of telecommunication services\" where U.S. West Communications\\n was a party). Professor Davis also suggests that the proper distinction lies in the nature of\\n the fact alleged to have been prejudged, not in the nature of the proceeding. He calls the\\n Cinderella case \"[a]n outstanding example of disqualification for prejudgment of adjudica-\\n tive facts.\" DAVIS, supra, at 382. He notes that the leading case of FTC v. Cement Institute,\\n 333 U.S. 683 (1948), where the FTC issued cease and desist orders against 74 companies,\\n involved so-called \"legislative facts,\" not adjudicative facts, such that \"the question whether\\n the Commission\\'s proceeding was adjudication or rulemaking was of no consequence.\"\\n DAVIS, supra, at 414.\\n 413. See DCP Farms v. Yeutter, 957 F.2d 1183, 1187-88 (5th Cir. 1992) (holding com-\\n munications between Congress and agencies over policy issues or administration of a con-\\n gressionally created program are legitimate part of Congress\\' oversight role and should not\\n be restricted).\\n \\n 1192\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n the transparency of the agency\\'s proceeding. Second, political involvement\\n can encourage the agency to decide a matter based on factors not included\\n in a statute as relevant to the agency\\'s consideration. A reliance on imper-\\n missible factors renders an agency decision arbitrary.414 Here too, the\\n courts have taken into account the practical factors affecting the relation-\\n ship between agencies and their political overseers.\\n Political contacts by the executive branch can be viewed as violations of\\n agency independence. The notion is that the executive chooses the com-\\n mission member, particularly the chairman, because of a consonance be-\\n tween his or her political views and the President\\'s views. The President\\n may further give him a general route to follow. But when the new member\\n \"sails off\" in the general direction urged upon him, he has to maintain radio\\n silence. This consequence of this silence is that he will lack the kind of\\n reinforcement or mid-course correction provided to an executive branch\\n employee.\\n The APA has explicit prohibitions against ex parte contacts that affect\\n all agencies and complement the law of bias. Such provisions prohibit\\n \"[an] interested person outside the agency\" from communicating off-the-\\n record with any agency official, whether a member of the staff or a political\\n appointee, \"who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in the de-\\n cisional process of the proceeding.\\'\"415 They also prohibit any decisional\\n official within the agency from making an ex parte communication to \"any\\n interested person outside the agency.\\'416 Because they are included in sec-\\n tion 557, they are applicable only to formal proceedings and the courts\\n have recognized the distinction between the agency\\'s activity as adjudica-\\n tor and rule-maker. The Fifth Circuit\\'s decision in the leading case of\\n Pillsbury Company v. FTC417 established the proposition that the courts can\\n set aside an agency\\'s decision in a formal adjudication where it appears\\n that agency members were unduly influenced by a congressional investiga-\\n tion of a case pending before the agency.41 8 Since the high water mark of\\n 414. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\\'n v. State Farm Mut. Aut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 46\\n (1983) (concluding agency\\'s decision to rescind rule was arbitrary and capricious).\\n 415.

It would seem that anyone with suffi-\\n cient concern to contact the agency on the merits of a case would qualify as an \"interested\\n person.\"\\n 417. 354 F.2d 952 (5th Cir. 1966).\\n 418. See id. at 964 (stating that Congress is intervening in agency\\'s judicial function\\n when investigation focuses on mental processes of Commission).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 1193\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n the Pillsbury case, however, courts have been exceedingly reluctant to con-\\n demn members of Congress when they openly express their views to agen-\\n cies. They recognize that members of Congress and the Administration\\n cannot be prevented from attempting to influence agency decisions.419\\n The prohibitions on congressional (and Executive) intervention in formal\\n adjudicatory proceedings, as outlined in Pillsbury, do not extend to. less\\n formal agency adjudicatory activity. Examining an agency\\'s pre-hearing\\n informal activities, the Fifth Circuit observed that the test (at least in such\\n circumstances) should be whether the congressional contacts urged the\\n agency to rely on factors that are not relevant under the statute420a stan-\\n dard with which an agency\\'s skilled professional writing staff should be\\n able to comply.421\\n Ex parte contacts in a rule-making proceeding of a policy nature are not\\n prohibited. In Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC,422 the D.C. Circuit Court ap-\\n peared to change the law by concluding that ex parte contacts impermissi-\\n bly compromised the court\\'s obligation to review an agency\\'s decision\\n based on the body of material contained in the paper record.423 Nonethe-\\n less, shortly thereafter, in Action for Children\\'s Television v. FCC,424 the\\n D.C. Circuit made it clear that ex parte prohibitions in rule-making pro-\\n ceedings were only applicable when the proceedings involved competing\\n private claims to a valuable privilege, i.e., when they resembled adjudica-\\n tory proceedings.45 That limitation is now clearly established.426\\n 419, See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Federal Power Comm\\'n, 563 F.2d 588, 611 (3d Cir. 1977).\\n The court characterized the congressional interest as directed more toward the agency\\'s pro-\\n cesses (the case had taken too long to decide) than its substantive outcome, and that any \"in-\\n cidental intrusions\" did not actually affect the agency\\'s decision. See id. Similarly, in\\n California v. FERC, 966 F.2d 1541, 1552 (9th Cir. 1992), the court declined to upset an\\n agency decision where the congressional correspondence, although from a powerful com-\\n mittee chairman, did not introduce new evidence or inquire into the agency\\'s decisional pro-\\n cesses. But see Portland Audubon Soc\\'y v.

Such file is not part of the re-\\n cord for decisional purposes.427 However, the availability of such a file\\n gives members of Congress a useful vehicle for transmitting constituent\\n views or even their own opinions. The file also accords agencies a respect-\\n ful way to acknowledge off-the-record submissions by noting that they\\n have been placed in a public file, without compromising the integrity of the\\n agency\\'s proceedings.428\\n Even in formal adjudications, courts demand that agencies simply follow\\n their own rules on ex parte contacts and attempt (as best they can) to resist\\n off-the-record pressure.

Cir. 1994).\\n 430. See id. at 1530. In ATX, Frank Lorenzo, who had previously been chief executive\\n of Eastern Air Lines during a period of tumultuous labor-management relations, filed an ap-\\n plication with the Department of Transportation to establish a new airline. See id. at 1524.\\n At the urging of labor unions, over 60 members of Congress, including key committee\\n chairmen, wrote strong letters to the Secretary requesting that he deny Lorenzo\\'s applica-\\n tion. See id. at 1527. Two members of Congress introduced legislation to prevent Lorenzo\\n from reentering the business. See id. at 1525. The Secretary ordered that the application be\\n set for public hearing before an agency administrative law judge and that the final decision\\n be made by the Department\\'s senior career official. See ATX, 41 F.3d at 1525. The Secre-\\n tary also responded to the Congressional communications with a form letter indicating that\\n \"it would be inappropriate for me to discuss the merits of the case with you,\" that the con-\\n gressional correspondence would be placed in the \"ex pane file,\" and noting that the appli-\\n cation would be thoroughly reviewed. Id. at 1525. Following the hearing at which one\\n congressman actually testified, the decisional official, Deputy Assistant Secretary Murphy, a\\n career civil servant serving temporarily as Acting Assistant Secretary, rendered a 75-page\\n opinion based entirely on the public record. See id at 1526. That was about all the agency\\n could do considering the circumstances, and the court upheld its decision even though the\\n agency denied Lorenzo\\'s application, which was what the members of Congress had ini-\\n tially requested. See id. at 1532. It was probably helpful to the agency\\'s position in court\\n that it had affirmed its administrative law judge\\'s decision. However, as long as the agency\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n 1195\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n 3. Agency Supervision of Its Members\\n It is not entirely clear if multi-member agencies have a collegial obliga-\\n tion to evaluate one of their members to determine if he or she should be\\n disqualified from a proceeding. The legislative history of the APA sug-\\n gests that the agency\\'s power to disqualify is limited to its presiding offi-\\n cers.131 But permitting a \"biased\" agency member to participate in a case\\n can clearly call the agency\\'s substantive decision into question. For exam-\\n ple, in Berkshire Employees Ass \\'n v. NLRB,432 the court determined that the\\n litigants were entitled to an unbiased tribunal, but recognized that it was\\n impossible to determine if one member influenced his or her colleagues.\\n Under these circumstances, the agency was required to \"determine for it-\\n self\\' whether one of its members should be disqualified from participa-\\n tion.\"\\'\\n Only a handful of agencies have regulations that explicitly address\\n whether the agency may independently determine whether one of its mem-\\n bers should be disqualified from participation in a particular case. Agen-\\n cies that have considered the matter have taken different positions. Most\\n agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, provide that\\n the decision to disqualify a member from a proceeding \"rests with that in-\\n dividual member.\"434 Nevertheless, in at least one case, the SEC collec-\\n tively investigated allegations of bias after the two commissioners against\\n whom the allegations were brought voluntarily agreed to have their col-\\n leagues assess their culpability.435 The Federal Trade Commission\\'s regu-\\n lations, however, allow the Commission to disqualify a commissioner in\\n the event that the commissioner in question declines to recuse himself or\\n had taken proper account of the presiding officer\\'s decision, and had reached a reasonable\\n result supported by the evidence, the agency was entitled to make its own independent as-\\n sessment of the facts and substitute its judgment for that-of the ALJ on issues of law, policy,\\n or discretion. See ATX, 41 F.3d at 1523; see also Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340\\n U.S. 474 (1951); Valkering, U.S.A., Inc. v. Department of Agric., 48 F.3d 305, 308-09 (8th\\n Cir. 1995) (holding that Secretary of Agriculture, reviewing decision of ALJ, is authorized\\n to substitute his judgment for that of ALJ).\\n 43 1.

Where the term of the allegedly biased member expired, and the remaining\\n agency members (including two who were not agency members at the time of the earlier\\n decision) reconsidered the case, the court subsequently declined to examine the allegations\\n of bias against the former member. See id.\\n 434. 17 C.F.R. § 200.60 (1999).\\n 435.

Recusal\\n Neither the APA nor case law indicates whether, and in what circum-\\n stances, an agency official who has not yet been legally disqualified from a\\n matter, should exercise his or her discretion not to participate in the interest\\n of avoiding an appearance of conflict of interest. The principal court deci-\\n sion that evaluates an agency member\\'s discretionary decision not to recuse\\n is Center for Auto Safety v. FTC.438 Judge Harold Greene reviewed the re-\\n cusal policies of several high level government officials and determined\\n that the then-chairman of the FTC did not abuse his discretion in declining\\n to recuse himself from a proceeding involving a former client.439\\n Judge Greene indicated that \"[a]bsent an abuse of discretion, the deci-\\n sion with regard to recusal is that of the official who is directly in-\\n volved.440 Agency members appear to have different philosophies in this\\n regard. Former FTC Commissioner Maclntyre\\'s decision in the National\\n Biscuit Co.441 case reflected his determination not to let his participation\\n delay the resolution of a case. In contrast, former NRC Chairman Pallad-\\n ino\\'s refused to step down in Long Island Lighting Co.442 because he feared\\n that if he did so, he would \"[appear] to give credence to an accusation that\\n aims baseless charges of impropriety not just at me,\" but at other NRC of-\\n ficials as well. ,143\\n 436.

THE TENSION BETWEEN AUTONOMY AND ACCOUNTABILITY\\n A. The Needfor Accountability and the Independent Administrator\\n Concept\\n A central question addressed by the form, structure and operations of\\n administrative agencies is whether accountability should be focused in one\\n place, or if it should be diffused. The debate has been ongoing since crea-\\n tion of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887. Placing decisional\\n responsibility with a group ensures that the group takes into account di-\\n verse policy perspectives and that it adopts moderate policies. Consensus-\\n building through compromise can also produce a broader range of public\\n acceptance for those decisions ultimately reached. This approach has espe-\\n cially drawn favor where agencies serve as adjudicators, deciding licensing,\\n rate-making, antitrust and similar cases that typically involve the resolution\\n of issues affecting individual rights.\\n It is important to assign accountability in one place for two interrelated\\n reasons. First, accountability is vital to a proper implementation of demo-\\n cratic principles in the administrative state. The American public and\\n elected representatives can examine the activities of unelected official, de-\\n termine the identity of the person who completed each act, and evaluate the\\n success or failure of a particular initiative. Officials who are appointed by\\n the President and who serve at the President\\'s pleasure are, to some degree\\n at least, the President\\'s responsibility. Eventually, the President\\'s ap-\\n pointments and policies will be tested at the polls during the presidential\\n elections.\\n Second, accountability can translate into better decisionmaking. For ex-\\n ample, Professor William Kovacic examined appointments to the Federal\\n Trade Commission and concluded that, as a threshold matter, \"[r]eplacing a\\n multi-member structure with a smaller number of commissioners or a sin-\\n gle administrator probably increases the likelihood that more nominees will\\n be highly qualified.444 Kovacic also believes that this approach narrows\\n the ability of the President to appoint, or the Congress to endorse, candi-\\n dates with weak qualifications.445 We would argue that a strong adminis-\\n trator can establish policy, create clear lines of responsibility for imple-\\n mentation of that policy, and eliminate delay in at least certain aspects of\\n an organization\\'s operation by shifting resources. But we doubt that the\\n 444. William E. Kovacic, The Quality of Appointments and the Capability of the Fed-\\n eral Trade Commission, 49 ADMIN. L. REv. 915, 948 (1997).\\n 445. See id. at 948-49.\\n \\n 1198\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n reduction in the size of multi-member agencies alone is likely to improve\\n the quality of appointees.\\n The perceived ineffectiveness of collegial decisionmaking at the Nuclear\\n Regulatory Commission at the time of the Three Mile Island accident, and\\n the benefits of centralized control, were arguments advanced in 1988 and\\n 1989 for replacing that multi-member commission with a single adminis-\\n trator. Senator John Breaux of Louisiana observed:\\n I sincerely believe that the benefits of a Commission process are largely illu-\\n sory.\\n I think it is fair to say that we have learned that we primarily have both people\\n and organizational problems with nuclear energy, not technological problems.\\n ... [L]ess than 10 percent of the decisions that have come from the agency\\n [over a 3-year period] can be attributed to collegial discussions occurring in an open\\n meeting when a majority of the Commissioners are present. A more cursory exami-\\n nation of the record since 1975 indicates that this pattern is not far from the norm of\\n every Commission during that time-frame.46\\n In contrast, a perceived lack of independence led Congress in 1994 to\\n remove the SSA from the Department of Health and Human Services\\n 447\\n (HHS) and establish it as an independent agency.\\n The structure that Congress adopts for a particular agency depends both\\n on what it expects from the agency and what it can achieve politically.\\n Should an agency be personally answerable to the President or, should it,\\n like the independent agencies, have a measure of autonomy? The structural\\n and organizational options theoretically available to Congress are quite\\n varied. At one time or another, Congress has created departments, offices,\\n boards, commissions, government corporations, quasi-public government-\\n sponsored enterprises, and foundations-almost as many types of govern-\\n mental units as there are problems to solve and programs to administer.448\\n 446. 135 CONG. REc. 8530 (1989).\\n 447. The Administrator of SSA is appointed by the President with the advice and con-\\n sent of the Senate to a six-year term and may be removed only for \"neglect of duty or mal-\\n feasance in office.\" 42 U.S.C. § 902(a)(l)-(3) (1994). Her budget is submitted to Congress\\n by the President without revision. See 42 U.S.C. § 904(b) (1994).\\n 448. See CONG. RESEARCH SERV. FOR THE SENATE COMM. ON GOV\\'T AFFAIRS. 96TH\\n CONG., THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE ESTABLISHMENT: EVOLUTION AND TRENDS 21 (Comm.\\n Print 1980).\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 1199\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n In our experience, the benefits of one type of structure can also be found\\n to some degree in the other. On the one hand, there are few agencies that\\n are both headed by a single person and deemed to be genuinely monolithic.\\n They often have staff components that reflect different viewpoints. They\\n are subjected to a multiplicity of outside pressures. Compromises are made\\n internally as recommendations move up the chain to the ultimate decision-\\n maker. On the other hand, statutes establishing multi-member organiza-\\n tions tend to minimize confusion by resting day-to-day administrative re-\\n sponsibility in the hands of one of the members. Moreover, as a practical\\n matter, not every member of a multi-member agency is interested in every\\n issue. Thus, a single member may well take a keen interest only with re-\\n spect to a specific project or matter. Indeed, as noted above, the chairman\\n at many federal multi-member agencies is likely to exercise both manage-\\n ment and policy leadership.\\n Congress\\' decision not to place an agency explicitly within the executive\\n branch can bear on the ability of the Administration or Congress to super-\\n intend its activities.449 Agencies that are perceived to be \"independent\"\\n usually were intended to have this characteristic. They are also generally\\n believed to be less responsive to the policy direction of an incumbent\\n President than appointees who serve expressly at his pleasure. In our expe-\\n rience, this outcome did not result because independent agency officials\\n were unwilling or unable to follow policy direction. Rather, it is because,\\n right or wrong, both sides believe that there must be less interactive com-\\n munications between the President and his staff and his \"independent\" ap-\\n pointees, and more freedom by such appointees to reach their own deci-\\n sions without direct consultation with Administration policymakers. The\\n appointees of independent agencies, in other words, are often left largely to\\n their own devices. Frequently, they align themselves with congressional\\n committees.45° It is difficult to rearrange established relationships whether\\n increased accountability or increased independence is the objective.\\n As we discuss later, Senate efforts to transform the multi-member Nu-\\n clear Regulatory Commission into a single administrator structure were un-\\n availing despite the public concern over government responsibility in the\\n wake of the Three Mile Island accident.

But see STRAUSS, supra note 5, at 92 (suggesting that differences in political lead-\\n ership should not overwhelm a larger sense of similarity between multi-member agencies\\n and those situated more directly in executive branch).\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n 1200\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n multi-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission more squarely un-\\n der presidential control by replacing it with a single commissioner, were\\n both equally unsuccessful (at least so far).\\n For its part, the Executive Branch, no matter how demanding its rhetoric,\\n has been relatively loath to require independent agencies to follow tradi-\\n tional executive oversight procedures. When President Reagan issued Ex-\\n ecutive Order 12,291 in 1981 requiring agencies to submit proposed and\\n final rules to OMB for clearance, and Executive Order 12,498 in 1985 re-\\n quiring agencies to submit their anticipated regulatory initiatives to OMB\\n annually, both excutive orders exemped the multi-member independent\\n agencies.451 President Bush took an initial step by distributing in January\\n 28, 1992 to both department heads and independent agencies a memoran-\\n dum entitled \"Reducing the Burden of Government Regulation.\" The\\n memo placed a ninety-day freeze on new regulations so that a review of all\\n current regulations could be performed to identify regulations that unneces-\\n sarily inhibited U.S. economic growth.452 On September 30, 1993, Presi-\\n dent Clinton issued his own Executive Order 12,866.453 Although the\\n Clinton executive order retained the provision excluding independent agen-\\n cies from the requirement of submitting proposed and final rules to OMB,\\n it did extend the regulatory planning process to these agencies.454\\n B. Divided Accountability and Super Separation of Functions\\n The draftsmen of the APA rejected the principle that there must be a to-\\n tal separation of enforcement and adjudicatory functions through the estab-\\n lishment of separate agencies. The concentration of functions within the\\n same agency, and even in the same person, does not automatically violate\\n recognized principles of due process.455 Nonetheless, the APA requires\\n that, within an agency, employees who are involved in adversarial pro-\\n 451.

Only a year after enactment of the APA,\\n Congress rejected the general APA-model in the labor-management con-\\n text. In the Taft-Hartley Act,457 Congress modified the structure of the Na-\\n tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to allow the Board\\'s General Coun-\\n sel to be appointed -by the President with the advice and consent of the\\n Senate and to have independent authority to prosecute unfair labor practice\\n charges.458 The General Counsel\\'s discretion whether or not to prosecute is\\n not reviewable by the Board itself. Further, the NLRB members have per-\\n sonal assistants who review the record in particular cases but, unlike most\\n agencies, the NLRB may not establish a review staff to advise the mem-\\n bers.459 It was fear of pro-labor commissioners that led Congress to amend\\n the Taft-Hartley Act to insulate the \"charging\" function from the Board.460\\n In 1952, the members of the FCC, and the agency\\'s administrative law\\n judges (then called examiners) were statutorily prohibited from having a\\n review staff.461 The prohibition was dropped in 1961 .462 The Senate Com-\\n mittee explained that such a strict prohibition against access to the agency\\'s\\n expert staff was \"wasteful and inefficient.463\\n In 1998, congressional dislike of the Federal Election Commission led to\\n an effort to split off that agency\\'s General Counsel, making him an advice\\n and consent appointee of the President rather than a civil servant directly\\n 456.

Among the functions transferred to DOT was\\n the Board\\'s responsibility for adjudicating competing international route\\n licensing applications. Historically, such licensing cases were heard ini-\\n tially by one of the Board\\'s administrative law judges but the decisions of\\n ALJs were always reviewed by the Board itself and then transmitted to the\\n President, who made the final decision.469 To allay concerns that interna-\\n tional licensing cases would henceforth be decided on political grounds, the\\n DOT informed Congress that it would create procedures that \"insulated\"\\n certain decisions from political pressure. Congress acquiesced in those as-\\n surances.470\\n Review Commission decides cases. See Mintz, supra note 459, at 885.\\n 469. See Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S.

Congress authorized the DOT to process applications either through\\n the traditional hearing method or through simplified non-hearing procedures. See 49 U.S.C.\\n § 41111 (1994). Implementing the legislation, the DOT issued regulations that provided,\\n among other things, that \"[c]arrier selection proceedings for international route authority\\n and such other hearing cases as the Secretary deems appropriate\" would be adjudicated\\n through a hearing process, and the final decision would be made by the Department\\'s \"sen-\\n ior career official.\" 14 C.F.R. § 302.22a(b)(4) (2000). Final decisions by the senior career\\n official are subject to a \"petition for reconsideration\" filed with the Assistant Secretary. But\\n the regulations limit the Assistant Secretary\\'s options to affirming the decision or remanding\\n it for further action pursuant to instructions-options more limited than the normal deci-\\n sional options available when an agency reviews a presiding officer\\'s decision. The APA\\n provides that an agency has all the powers when reviewing an initial or recommended deci-\\n sion that it would have in making the decision in the first instance. See § 7(a), 5 U.S.C. §\\n 556(b) (1994). An agency may, with some limitations, review the evidence de novo and\\n substitute its judgment on issues of law, policy, discretion and even facts, for that of its pre-\\n siding officer.

Oversight Agencies\\n On occasion, Congress uses the multi-member agency as a check on the\\n work of the executive branch departments. Although the work of these\\n agencies is entirely or primarily advisory, their multi-member structure\\n \"diffuses\" power and inhibits executive control of a process designed to re-\\n view the executive.\\n Examples of this type of agencies are the Defense Nuclear Facilities\\n Safety Board (DNFSB), the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB),\\n the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) and the Postal\\n Rate Commission (PRC). The DNFSB reviews the design of defense nu-\\n clear facilities run by the Department of Energy (DOE), makes recommen-\\n dations to DOE regarding the safety of these facilities, and investigates\\n events or practices at these facilities that may affect public health or safety.\\n The NTSB investigates civil aviation accidents and significant accidents in\\n other modes of transportation and makes recommendations to the FAA and\\n other bodies.47\\' The CSB investigates the probable cause of accidental\\n chemical releases in much the same way as the NTSB investigates trans-\\n portation accidents. The CSB also conducts research and issues reports\\n concerning the safety of chemical production.472 The PRC is an adjudica-\\n tory agency that issues formal recommendations regarding changes the\\n Postal Service proposes regarding postal rates, fees and mail classification.\\n Although Congress requires that executive departments respond to recom-\\n mendations in some fashion,473 none of the multi-member agencies has the\\n power to enforce its recommendations.\\n A skepticism about the executive branch agencies\\' ability to police\\n themselves undergirds the creation of these advisory boards. They are de-\\n signed as an independent check on the regulatory or operational activities\\n of the executive branch. As the Senate Report observed when setting up\\n the Chemical Safety Board:\\n 471. See 49 U.S.C. § 1131 (1994). The NTSB also has regulatory responsibility for the\\n administrative trial and appellate review of FAA and Coast Guard decisions assessing civil\\n penalties or affecting the certificates of pilots, mariners, or mechanics. See id. § 1133.\\n 472. See id. § 7412(r)(6)(C).\\n 473. For example, the Secretary of Labor must respond within 180 days to recommen-\\n dations of the Chemical Safety Board. See 42 U.S.C. § 7412(r)(6)(J). The Labor Depart-\\n ment must indicate whether the Secretary will initiate a rule-making or issue orders to im-\\n plement the CSB\\'s recommendations. \"Any determination by the Secretary not to\\n implement a recommendation or to implement a recommendation only in part ... shall be\\n accompanied by a statement from the Secretary setting forth the reasons for such determi-\\n nation.\" Id.\\n \\n 2000]\\n \\n 1205\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n [lit is unlikely that an agency charged both with rule-making and investigating func-\\n tions would be quick to acknowledge that existing requirements were insufficient to\\n prevent an accident. In fact, the investigations conducted by agencies with dual re-\\n sponsibilities tend to focus on violations of existing rules as the cause of the accident\\n almost to the exclusion of other contributing factors for which no enforcement or\\n compliance actions can be taken. The purpose of an accident investigation (as\\n authorized here) is to determine the cause or causes of an accident whether or not\\n those causes were in violation of any current and enforceable requirement.\\n .... [T]he [multi-member advisory agency] is created as an independent source\\n of expertise which may make recommendations for rules and orders .... 474\\n D. Independent Agencies in the Executive Branch\\n In Morrison v. Olson,475 the Chief Justice decided whether a statutory\\n provision had impermissibly restrained the President\\'s power to control ex-\\n ecutive branch officials. In the opinion, he indicated that the focus is on\\n whether any removal restriction \"impermissibly burdens the President\\'s\\n power to control or supervise the [appointee], as an executive official, in\\n the execution of his or her duties under the Act.\\'A76 Phrased differently,\\n does the limitation \"interfere impermissibly with [the President\\'s] constitu-\\n tional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.\\',7 In the dis-\\n senting opinion, Justice Scalia characterized the Court\\'s approach as \"an\\n open invitation for Congress to experiment.\"\\'478 What about \"a special As-\\n sistant Secretary of Defense for Procurement?\" he asked.479 Frankly, no\\n one knows. If the Court\\'s approach was indeed an invitation, Congress has\\n rarely accepted it.\\n Multi-member agencies emerged in the 1880s as the regulatory vehicle\\n of choice, and flowered during the New Deal.480 In recent years, that\\n regulatory model has been largely replaced by congressional and Presiden-\\n tial interest in agencies with a single head.

The Special Counsel, who heads the agency, is responsible for\\n enforcing the ban on so-called prohibited personnel practices by federal\\n agencies, especially those involving whistleblowers, ensuring compliance\\n with provisions of the Hatch Act that deals with political activity, and\\n prosecuting cases involving denial of federal benefits to veterans and re-\\n servists.483 The agency itself is small and employs about ninety employ-\\n ees.484 To ensure the agency\\'s independence, Congress provided that the\\n Special Counsel be appointed by the President, with the advice and consent\\n of the Senate. The Special Counsel serves a five-year term and may be re-\\n moved from office only for the classical reasons-\"inefficiency, neglect of\\n duty, or malfeasance in office.\"485 The Special Counsel is given explicit\\n statutory power to submit reports and testimony simultaneously to Con-\\n 486\\n gress and the President.

When Congress\\n enacted the Special Counsel legislation, President Clinton, based on advice\\n from the DOJ, opined that the removal provision raised a significant con-\\n stitutional question.492 Although not all innovative approaches offend sepa-\\n ration of powers principles, each must be analyzed from both policy and\\n constitutional perspectives. However, Congress\\' determination is entitled\\n to some weight. Whether Congress\\' judgment in these two cases is suffi-\\n cient to override the President\\'s ordinary authority over executive branch\\n officials has yet to be seen.\\n The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) recently evaluated the President\\'s\\n removal power as part of a wide-ranging reappraisal of separation of pow-\\n ers issues.493 OLC observed:\\n The Supreme Court\\'s removal cases establish a spectrum of potential conclusions\\n about specific removal limitations. At one end of the spectrum, restrictions on the\\n President\\'s power to remove officers with broad policy responsibilities in areas Con-\\n gress does not or cannot shelter from presidential policy control clearly should be\\n deemed unconstitutional.

At the other end of the spectrum,\\n we believe that for cause and fixed term limitations on the power to remove officers\\n with adjudicatory duties affecting the rights of private individuals will continue to\\n meet with consistent judicial approval: the contention that the essential role of the ex-\\n ecutive branch would be imperiled by giving a measure of independence to such offi-\\n cials is untenable under both precedent and principle.\\n Between these two extremes, the arguments are less clear .... In situations in which\\n Congress does not enact express removal limitations, we believe that the executive\\n branch should resist any further application of the Wiener rationale, under which a\\n court may infer the existence of a for-cause limit on presidential removal, except with\\n respect to officers whose only functions are adjudicatory.49\\n Given the nature of the Social Security Administration\\'s primary func-\\n tion, the \"for cause\" removal provision seems quite likely to withstand con-\\n stitutional attack. The Special Counsel statute is more problematic, but\\n would probably meet the Morrison v. Olson test. However, neither statute\\n may actually be challenged on constitutional grounds. There appears to be\\n little incentive for an aggrieved party to claim that the agency head should\\n not be independent. Therefore, it appears likely that this new form of\\n agency will join the others among the accepted structures of government\\n institutions.495\\n 494. Id. at * 147-*49.\\n 495. The recent restructuring of the Federal Aviation Administration reflects a useful\\n illustration of an agency head who, despite some statutory changes, remains under the\\n President\\'s plenary control. In the agency\\'s 1996 Reauthorization Act, Congress provided\\n that the Administrator shall continue to be appointed by the President with the advice and\\n consent of the Senate, as before, but shall now serve a five-year term. See 49 U.S.C. §\\n 106(b) (1994 & Supp. IV 1998). There is no \"for cause\" removal provision. Moreover, the\\n Administrator continues to report to the Secretary of Transportation. See id. These statutory\\n provisions create a strong presumption that Congress did not intend to alter the President\\'s\\n historic removal power over the Administrator. The five-year term appears simply to be a\\n political compromise designed to encourage continuity of office by according the Adminis-\\n trator some added decisional and management freedom. The legislative history supports\\n this reading of the statute. H.R. 2276, an early version of the reauthorization legislation,\\n would have removed the FAA from the Department of Transportation and replaced the cur-\\n rent Administrator position with a three-member Presidentially-appointed Board whose\\n members could only be removed for cause. See H.R. REP. No. 104-475, pt. I, at 25 (1996).\\n The Senate approach, which was enacted, simply added a five-year term for the Adminis-\\n trator. See 49 U.S.C. § 106(b); see also S. REP No. 104-333 (1996). In contrast, the single,\\n ten-year term for the Director of the FBI indicates a congressional intent to limit a director\\'s\\n tenure. See Kenneth Williams, Gays in the Military: The Legal Issues, 28 U.S.F. L. REV.\\n 919, 954 n.286 (1994). As with the FAA administrator, the FBI director\\'s tenure provision\\n does not prevent summary removal by the President before the term expires.\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n V. THE FUTURE OF THE INDEPENDENT AGENCY\\n The independent agency has developed deep roots in the American ad-\\n ministrative state.   However, as this article suggests, the independent\\n agency reflects a political calculation of a specific time and place drawn\\n first from the 19th century British and state experience in railroad regula-\\n tion,496 followed by the Progressive movement\\'s elevation of experts and\\n \"the science of administration\"\\'497 into a governing cultural myth. The\\n number of independent agencies has not grown significantly since the\\n Great Society. Newer multi-member agencies often play more a supervi-\\n sory than a regulatory role-different from      their earlier counterparts.498\\n Some newer agencies were previously components of larger units. At\\n times, multi-member agencies have disappeared because they were trans-\\n mogrified into different forms,499 reorganized into more fashionable struc-\\n tural modes,500 or terminated because they completed their work.50\\' At the\\n same time, few multi-member agencies have been abolished.2 The Civil\\n 496.

The Assassination Records Review Board was established in 1994 as a temporary\\n agency to identify, collect, examine and disseminate materials relating to the assassination\\n of President John F.

The Board was composed of five members, appointed by the President with\\n Senate confirmation, from among individuals with distinguished professional reputations\\n and without regard for political affiliation, and including one lawyer and one professional\\n historian. See § 7(b)(4)-(5), 44 U.S.C. § 2017, at 604. Its members could only be removed\\n for cause.

The Board\\'s original three-year authorization was ex-\\n tended for an additional year. See Pub. L. 105-25, 111 Stat. 240 (1997).

Restructuring Multi-Member Agencies: The Single Member Option\\n Most congressional efforts to restructure agencies have generally re-\\n sulted in legislative paralysis. This is due principally to division among\\n relevant interest groups and executive branch opposition to any desiderata\\n of agency independence. The SSA is an interesting exception.\\n 1. Social Security Administration\\n The depression-era SSA has had an interesting institutional history.504 In\\n 1935, President Roosevelt sent Congress legislation to establish a Social\\n Insurance Board as part of the Department of Labor. After receiving the\\n legislation, the House and Senate divided on the institutional placement of\\n the new entity. The Senate backed the Roosevelt approach and the House\\n favored the creation of an independent agency.505 In the end, the House\\n the Commission\\'s status within the Interior Department, although the Interior Secretary later\\n testified that he in fact exercised no control over the Commission\\'s activities. See\\n CUSHMAN, supra note 10, at 379-80, 387-88. Key features of the Commission\\'s enabling\\n statute were declared unconstitutional in Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238 (1936).\\n Although the agency was later resuscitated by the Bituminous Coal Act of 1937, ch. 127, 50\\n Stat. 72, it was eliminated as part of a presidential reorganization plan in 1939, and its func-\\n tions were transferred directly to the Interior Department. See CUSHMAN, supra note 10, at\\n 388-89. Cushman observes that the Commission \"passed out of the picture, apparently un-\\n lamented.\" Id. at 389.\\n 503. See Theodore J. Lowi, President v.

The Social Security Act of 1935 established a three-\\n member agency known as the Social Security Board506 to administer the old\\n age and survivors insurance, unemployment compensation, and public as-\\n sistance programs. The Board had many of the characteristics of an inde-\\n pendent multi-member agency except it did not have an explicit statutory\\n provision governing removal of members.507\\n A mere four years after its creation, the. Board lost its independent status.\\n In the Reorganization Plan I of 1939, President Roosevelt created the Fed-\\n eral Security Agency (FSA), a sub-cabinet level entity, to administer a\\n range of programs, including the U.S. Public Health Service, the Civilian\\n Conservation Corps, and the Office of Education. The reorganization plan\\n retained the Social Security Board but it was placed under the jurisdiction\\n of the FSA.5°8\\n Then, in 1946, the Board lost its multi-member status. Reorganization\\n Plan 2 of 1946 abolished the Social Security Board and transferred its\\n functions directly to the FSA.509 Then President Truman praised the\\n Board\\'s work but characterized its status as an \"anomaly.\" In the Presi-\\n dent\\'s view, the \"existence of a department within a department [was] a se-\\n vere barrier to effective integration.\"510 The FSA Administrator created the\\n position of SSA Commissioner and named the Board\\'s Chairman as the\\n first Commissioner of Social Security.\\n In 1953, the FSA was abolished and its functions, including those of the\\n SSA, were transferred to the newly established Department of Health, Edu-\\n cation and Welfare.51   Later, the SSA became a central part of HHS when\\n 506. See Social Security Act of 1935, ch. 531, 74-271, § 701, 49 Stat. 635 (1935).\\n 507.

In the 1990s, the classic institutional battle arose\\n yet again. An agency backlog of disability cases, coupled with a re-\\n examination of disability claims that resulted in the numerous termination\\n of benefits, led to a perception that the agency lacked independence from\\n political control. Eventually, legislation was proposed to remove the Social\\n Security Administration from HHS and establish it as an independent\\n agency. The House favored the independent multi-member board format\\n akin to the one that it had favored in 1935, but the Senate\\'s preference pre-\\n vailed.13 This time, the new agency would be headed by a single individ-\\n ual whose independence would be protected by a statutory provision that\\n allows the President to remove the individual only for good cause.514\\n 2. Nuclear Regulatory Commission\\n The effort to replace the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with a\\n single administrator produced a more typical result. In the wake of the\\n Three Mile Island nuclear accident, a \"maze of reform proposals\" for the\\n NRC were introduced in Congress.515 Six separate bills were introduced in\\n the House of Representatives, covering the waterfront of administrative re-\\n organization and inter-branch issues. In particular, two bills, H.R. 3285\\n and H.R. 4134, would have replaced the Commission with a single admin-\\n istrator.516 Several bills reflected efforts to resolve the internal squabble\\n app. at 1488 (1994).\\n 512.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\\n The short-lived effort to replace the FERC with a single administrator\\n came as a surprise element of the Bush Administration\\'s 1991 National En-\\n ergy Strategy.5   Introduction of the National Energy Strategy itself \"fol-\\n lowed 10 years of work by lobbyists, academics, true-believer congres-\\n sional staff members, think-tank scholars, policy specialists and a handful\\n of aggressive industry leaders.526 However, the Bush Administration\\'s ef-\\n fort to abolish FERC was \"an eleventh hour recommendation\" by Vice\\n President Quayle\\'s Competitiveness Council.527\\n The proposed abolition of FERC appears to have been a rather sweeping\\n response to the chronic delays that were seemingly endemic in the agency\\'s\\n proceedings.52\\' But such significant structural change not only threatened\\n prevailing arrangements but lacked both the sense of urgency and the con-\\n sensus of \"elite opinion\" that Professors Martha Derthick and Paul Quirk\\n believe is essential to reform.529 There had also been little, if any, political\\n preparation. As a result, Congressman John Dingell, the Chairman of the\\n House Energy and Commerce Committee, urged the Administration to\\n separate it from the overall energy initiative,530 while Senator Bennett\\n Attorney General, to Sen.

In March 1991, he de-\\n fended his agency\\'s performance but offered no specific comment on the\\n reorganization.36 Three months later, when pressed by a House committee\\n for FERC\\'s views on the pending legislation, Chairman Allday chose to\\n submit only a staff analysis of the legislation that included the following,\\n somewhat Delphic, observation:\\n To the best of our knowledge, neither the Chairman nor the Commission recom-\\n mended a legislative proposal regarding the transfer of its functions.

As noted earlier, Congress also attempted to make the general\\n counsel of the Federal Election Commission a Senate-confirmed position\\n that could have allowed the Senate greater leverage regarding the FEC\\'s\\n docket.43 Finally, efforts were made in 1999 to create a separate agency\\n within the DOT to reduce truck accidents.544 As seen, the emphasis is no\\n longer on independence per se, but on clearer lines of authority and ac-\\n countability.\\n roles ....

Civil Aeronautics Board\\n The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) was in the business of regulating\\n airlines from 1938 to 1985.14\\' A 1982 article by one of the current authors\\n observed that a \"unique confluence of factors brought about airline de-\\n regulation.\"546 Among the key factors that influenced Congress was an im-\\n pressive empirical data-base (including clearly identifiable anecdotal evi-\\n dence) that conveyed the benefits of unregulated competition,547 the strong\\n divisions within the regulated sector over the continuing benefits of gov-\\n ernment intervention, the lack of a well-organized opposition to deregula-\\n tion, and the commitment of two presidential administrations and the\\n agency (and its staff) itself.48\\n Timing was critical. First, airline deregulation was on the agenda during\\n relatively prosperous and improving economic times for the airline indus-\\n try.549 Second, the CAB, which had historically been able to retain the loy-\\n alty of all segments of the airline industry to some extent, established poli-\\n cies during the Nixon Administration that divided the industry\\'s loyalty.550\\n 545. The Board had an ambiguous institutional beginning. It started life in 1938 as the\\n Civil Aeronautics Authority, with responsibility for economic and safety matters. See Civil\\n Aeronautics Act of 1938, ch. 601, 52 Stat. 973. The 1938 statute also established an Ad-\\n ministrator for the Authority, who was the forerunner of the Federal Aviation Administrator,\\n and a separate Air Safety Board to investigate accidents, which was an institutional precur-\\n sor to the National Transportation Safety Board. See CUsHtAN, supra note 10, at 401-02.\\n A Presidential Reorganization Plan in 1940 consolidated the functions of the Authority and\\n the Air Safety Board into a new Civil Aeronautics Board and placed the Board within the\\n Commerce Department. See Reorg. Plan No. 4 of 1940, 3 C.F.R. 1302 (1938-1943), re-\\n printed in 5 U.S.C. app. at 1444 (1994). The Administrator was placed under the direction\\n of the Secretary of Commerce. See id.; see also CUSHMAN, supra note 10, at 415-16. The\\n Board\\'s safety functions were shifted to the newly created Department of Transportation by\\n the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, Pub. L.

REv. 47, 48 (1972) (explaining how agencies receive support from all key\\n sectors of regulated sector by engaging in \"minimal squawk\" industry pacification behavior\\n in which no constituent group is disaffected in the longer term). There may also have been,\\n however, a generation component at work. Roy Pulsifer, a career government lawyer ac-\\n tively involved in promoting airline deregulation during his tenure at the Civil Aeronautics\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n 1218\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n By 1985, however, Congress abolished the CAB and transferred its sur-\\n viving functions to the Department of Transportation.55\\'\\n 2. Trucking Deregulation\\n Timing was also critical to trucking deregulation. Congress acted in\\n 1995 as part of the anti-regulation agenda that accompanied the Republican\\n take-over of Congress that year.52 But the ICC\\'s abolition had been in the\\n works for a while, and was ultimately only partial and somewhat symbolic.\\n Although the government regulation of trucking ended, Congress retained\\n railroad regulation and replaced the ICC with the smaller Surface Trans-\\n portation Board (STB). This action gave the STB, a new multi-member\\n agency, the responsibility of overseeing the gradual decrease of govern-\\n ment intervention in surface transportation.553 The railroad industry\\'s sup-\\n port for \"an industry-friendly forum for their mergers\"-rather than review\\n by the Department of Justice-and the support from congressional com-\\n mittees \"whose clout stood to be greatly diminished by elimination of the\\n Board, asked the essential question: \"Why ... should the criticisms that academic econo-\\n mists have been making for more than twenty years and government economists since the\\n early 1960s suddenly become popular issues, and why should the Administration be pro-\\n posing drastic changes in the law?\" Roy Pulsifer, Introduction, 41 J. AMR L. & COM. 573,\\n 575 (1975). His answer was provocative.\\n The basic reason appears to be that the end of the great post-World War I1 boom, and\\n the recent recession, compounded by the negative impact on income resulting from\\n petroleum price increases, have made the public sensitive to claims of the adverse\\n impact of economic regulation on consumer prices. Put another way, the impact of\\n governmental regulation on the allocation of resources, on how the pie is sliced, be-\\n comes a matter of intensified public concern when the overall economy, the pie, is\\n not expanding. A second factor, although far from understood, is the maturation of\\n the generation born during and in the decade after World War I. This group, by edu-\\n cation and upbringing in a time of prosperity, is skeptical of government protection-\\n ism, and is likely to call for changes in any government policy which does not maxi-\\n mize opportunity, including regulatory regimes that seem to favor the status quo in\\n industrial organization.\\n Id. at 575-77.\\n 551.

Comparative Examples\\n Administrative law scholarship in the United States understandably fo-\\n cuses on domestic rather than comparative elements,555 and most American\\n work in the field at least, proceeds from the view that our constitutional\\n framework is set in time, if not in stone. Still, it is worth considering the\\n extent to which centralization and its attendant mode-burearcratization may\\n or may not be the future of regulation in governments globally. In the post-\\n World War II era many thought bureaucracy was associated with concepts\\n such as tyranny and centralized authority.556 Indeed, in his exhaustive\\n study, Oriental Despotism, Karl Wittfogel concluded that the need for\\n \"large-scale and government-managed works of irrigation and flood con-\\n trol\" influenced the totalitarian structure of many ancient and medieval\\n eastern societies.57 Put otherwise, the marginal bureaucracy needed in or-\\n der to run and protect large-scale government public works projects can\\n lead all to easily to centralized state control.558\\n Modern (meaning before the fall of the Berlin wall) Marxist scholars\\n recognized the dangers inherent in what some termed the bureaucratisation\\n du mond.559 Liberals prophesized that a knowledge-based elite, be they\\n scientists or engineers, were taking over.560  Conservatives bewailed the\\n 554.

True, in the United States, the constitutional norm of the \"unitary\"\\n executive creates normative pressure toward centralization in the federal\\n administrative state. Nonetheless empirical sociology suggests a structural,\\n dare we say, extraconstitutional tension, between bureaucracy and centrali-\\n zation and subsidiarity and local flexibility which affects regulatory efforts\\n in and out of the United States. Rather than centralization, it is possible\\n that the priciples of subsidiarity, accountability and lines of authority in\\n other countries who, like us, have drank deeply from the administrative\\n state. There can be little doubt that centrifugal pressures toward diffused\\n bureaucratic accountability, or what some have called \"diffused sover-\\n eignty,\\'563 have dramatically affected the bureaucratic structure of the ad-\\n ministrative state outside of the United States.\\n The rich variety of pragmatic and eclectic organizational structures and\\n differing elements of political control that characterize American adminis-\\n trative management appear in European public administration as well. As\\n in the United States, Departments or Ministries are under the control of a\\n minister (who is himself a member of the legislative branch), which are the\\n most prominent organizational units in European governments.64 None-\\n theless, European governments also deploy a diverse range of ad hoc gov-\\n scientific establishment); Daniel Bell, Notes on the Post-Industrial Society (I), PUB.\\n INTEREST, Winter 1967, at 27-28; Zbigniew Brzezinski, America in the Technetronic Age,\\n ENCOUNTER, Jan. 1968, at 16.\\n 561.

For example, in french administrative law there are:\\n [I]ndependent and autonomous agencies to regulate or supervise particular policies or\\n policy areas: the Commission Nationale de l\\'Informatique et des Libertds, which\\n regulates the use of computers and databases; the Conseil de la Concurrence, which\\n monitors monopolies, take-overs and restrictive practices; the Commission des Sond-\\n ages, which investigates complaints about opinion polls; the Commission de la Con-\\n sommation, which advises on consumer affairs; the Commission des Opgrations de\\n Bourse, which regulates the financial markets; and the Commission Nationale de\\n contr6le des campagnes ilectorales, which makes recommendations and monitors the\\n conduct of national electoral campaigns. In the areas of deregulated markets and pri-\\n vatized industries, such agencies have a major role in supervising the operation of the\\n market.

On the one hand, the European Commission is de-\\n signed to be free of domination by individual member states. Article 10 of\\n the Merger Treaty of 1965, which combined earlier European institutions,\\n expressly provides that commissioners must \"neither seek nor take instruc-\\n tions from any government or from any other body.572 On the other hand,\\n numerous EU agencies are designed to be only partially independent of the\\n Commission or the member states.573 So agencies are created with mana-\\n gerial, technical, or information gathering and analysis responsibilities, but\\n not ordinarily with independent regulatory power.574 To that extent, they\\n have some of the flavor of \"Sunshine Commissions\" of 19th century\\n America.

Professor Renaud\\n Dehousse suggests that their institutional position is something of a com-\\n promise. \"Agencies owe their existence to a kind of paradox. On the one\\n hand, increased uniformity is certainly needed; on the other hand, greater\\n centralization is politically inconceivable, and probably not desirable.577\\n Professor Martin Shapiro agrees that they are not genuinely free. of \"inter-\\n governmental politics.\\'578 These traits seem to be endemic in any demo-\\n cratic administration.\\n What is true for the U.S. and continental Europe is true for Britain as\\n well. A review of the British system demonstrates the apparent need for\\n independence in other large administrative states. In Britain, the depart-\\n ments of the national or central government, known as Departments of\\n State, are the most political entities, and resemble United States cabinet de-\\n partments in many respects.579 Each department is headed by a politically\\n accountable member of the government, usually a Secretary of State, but\\n relies on a large staff of civil servants. British secretaries of state are also\\n members of the legislative branch.\\n In 1968, the Fulton Committee on the Civil Service recommended the\\n \"hiving off\\' of certain responsibilities from government departments to\\n autonomous or semi-autonomous institutions.8 These \"children of de-\\n partments\\'\\'81 are not subject to direct political control. They are, however,\\n subject to certain financial, policy and performance arrangements that are\\n formulated by the Minister, the Permanent Secretary, and the agency head,\\n and embodied in a framework document.582 The performance of these\\n agencies is reviewed every three years.3 The bodies are unofficially re-\\n 576.

An outgrowth of the government\\'s \"Next Steps\"\\n Report in 1988,587 these agencies reflected devolution of power to non-\\n departmental agencies, largely in the areas of service delivery.588 As of\\n 1992, there were ninety-two Next Step agencies, including the Social Secu-\\n rity Benefits Agency, the Employment Service, the Passport Office, and the\\n Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.9\\n British Statutory Tribunals (at times called authorities, commissions,\\n committees, or tribunals) are primarily adjudicatory bodies, designed to ap-\\n ply an established body of rules to particular facts.590 With antecedents in\\n the 1600s,59\\' tribunals decide disputes involving specialty subject areas\\n such as employer-employee relations, social security, taxes, or immigra-\\n tion.592 These, independent tribunals are justified on much the same basis\\n as independent U.S. federal agencies.

An issue in many cases is what constitutes an\\n \"issue of law.\" Some scholars and court decisions divide matters into legal issues and fac-\\n tual issues. The latter includes inferences from so-called \"primary facts.\" See id. An im-\\n portant supervisory body-the Council on Tribunals-oversees the work of tribunals. It is a\\n purely advisory body but can make recommendations on tribunal membership and opera-\\n tions and must be consulted before any tribunal enacts new procedural regulations. See id.\\n at 146. The Council of 10-15 members includes both lawyers and non-lawyers but a major-\\n ity are laymen. See id. We should note that the British also have a highly developed system\\n of Ombudsmen. The principal Ombudsman, known as the Parliamentary Commissioner for\\n Administration, is responsible for investigating complaints concerning administrative func-\\n tions of the departments and agencies of the central government. See id at 127. There are\\n two principal restrictions on the Ombudsman\\'s authority. He may only entertain a com-\\n plaint referred to him by a member of Parliament and may not examine the merits of an\\n agency\\'s discretionary decisions. See id. He is charged, in other words, with investigating\\n \"maladministration.\" CRAIG, supra note 582, at 129. The Parliamentary Commissioner for\\n Administration also serves as the Ombudsman for the Health Services. However, in exer-\\n cising these powers, he may entertain complaints directly from the public. See id. at 134-35.\\n Finally, there are Commissions that serve as Ombudsmen over local government authorities\\n and a separate Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. See id. at 138. Another \"independent\"\\n structure for review of government action is the statutory inquiry. See id. at 160. The Brit-\\n ish employ the statutory inquiry as a governmental instrument that melds impartiality with\\n political accountability. The statutory inquiry process emerged in Britain in the latter part of\\n the 19th century as a means of resolving primarily local disputes between individuals and\\n public authorities, or between authorities and the national government. Inquiries are most\\n common in the areas of planning and development and serve as either an appeal mechanism\\n or a vehicle for the public presentation of views before government action is taken. See id.\\n For example, a local authority may refuse planning permission for a requested project and\\n the losing applicant can appeal. See id. Alternatively, the public may be asked to offer its\\n views before some form of application or request is granted. See CRAIG, supra note 582, at\\n 160. Generally, an independent person (or persons) is appointed to gather the facts and re-\\n port to the relevant minister. However, the minister, or one of his or her immediate associ-\\n ates, makes the final decision. See id. at 160-61.\\n \\n 1226\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n Several broad theories have been offered to justify creation of the myr-\\n iad of institutional arrangements outside the scope of the traditional British\\n government departments.\\n First, there is the \\'buffer\\' theory which sees them as a way of protecting certain ac-\\n tivities from political interference. Second, there is the \\'escape\\' theory which sees\\n them as escaping known weaknesses of traditional government departments. Third,\\n the \\'Corson\\' theory, following Mr. John Corson sees them as used to \\'put the activity\\n where the talent was\\', which might be outside government departments. Fourth,\\n there is the participation or \\'pluralistic\\' theory which thinks it desirable to spread\\n power. Fifth, there is the \\'back double\\' theory. This is based on the analogy with a\\n taxi-driver who finds the main streets too busy and therefore uses back streets-what\\n is known to taxi drivers as \\'back doubles.\\' The back double theory is that if govern-\\n ments, local authorities or other bodies find that they cannot do the things they want\\n within the existing structure, they set up new organisations which make it possible to\\n do them. Sixth, the \\'too many bureaucrats\\' view, mainly an American one, suggests\\n that if the public thinks a country has too many civil servants it can set up quasi-non-\\n governmental organisations whose employees are not classified as civil servants.59\\n Whatever the rationale, it is clear that the rest of the industrialized world\\n has seen fit, on occasion, to create administrative structures with diffused\\n lines of authority and accountability similar to the independent regulatory\\n agencies. Whether this is a reflection of a drive toward subsidarity or a re-\\n flection of the limits of centralized authority in technologically-driven soci-\\n ety remains to be seen.\\n D. American Perspectives\\n Notwithstanding the increased focus on issues of agency accountability\\n since the Great Society, recent years have seen a seeming efflorescence of\\n creative quasi-governmental administrative structures with varying levels\\n of government control. Private parties have taken over a variety of public\\n functions through \"contracting out\"599 and privatization.600  Public-private\\n 598. Id. at 82 (quoting PUBLIC POLICY AND PRIVATE INTERESTS: THE INSTITUTIONS OF\\n COMPROMISE 362 (Douglas C. Hague et al. eds., 1975)). Professors Wade and Forsyth view\\n the system in more pragmatic terms. As they see it, \"[t]ribunals are subject to a law of evo-\\n lution.\" WADE & FORSYTH, supra note 590, at 908. Each is devised for the purposes of\\n some particular statute and is, therefore, so to speak, tailor-made. See id.\\n Professor Birkinshaw would concur, but would seemingly go further. In his view,\\n \"[tihe method of regulation adopted by government over particular bodies or activities will\\n often reflect the degree of trust with which a body or institution is held by government.\"\\n BIRKtNSHAW, supra note 579, at 163.

Public corporations are largely controlled by\\n the federal government while GSEs are further removed from government\\n control.\\n 1. Public Corporations\\n Like independent agencies, public corporations are viewed as important\\n vehicles through which the business of government can be effectuated.\\n They include entities such as the Legal Services Corporation,604 the Corpo-\\n ration for Public Broadcasting,65 the United States Postal Service606 and\\n the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.607 The cornerstone of these en\\n tities has been their independence, which they obtained because of their lo-\\n cation outside the political realm. While they share similar characteristics\\n with the independent agencies-expertise, independence, and reduced ac-\\n countability-their corporate structure is the feature that sets them apart\\n from the independent agency.608 The public corporation was designed as a\\n profit-making entity that was self-sustaining and removed from the political\\n fray.

The ease by\\n which public functions can be assigned to non-governmental structures cre-\\n ate a structural problem for proponents of the unitary executive. Public\\n functions undertaken by public structures outside the executive branch have\\n limited executive oversight; privatized functions are under even less con-\\n trol.618 The sharp break between those structures subject to the \"unitari-\\n ness\" and those that are not, reflect a theoretical break not evident in real\\n life.\\n The public corporation became integrated into our government system\\n during the Progressive and New Deal eras. The structure of the public cor-\\n poration was appreciated by Progressives who espoused theories of scien-\\n tific management and valued its potential for efficiency and its freedom\\n from partisan politics.619 President Wilson stressed the need to bring busi-\\n ness principles to government and successfully compelled Congress to es-\\n tablish several public corporations during his years in office.620 During his\\n presidency, President Franklin D. Roosevelt increased the number of public\\n corporations, a trend which was continued throughout the New Deal.62\\'\\n President Roosevelt valued the public corporation because its structure lent\\n itself to experimentation.

They are run by a board of directors or governors\\n that is only partially composed of members who are appointed by the\\n President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.624 Since they are re-\\n moved from the tripartite system, they operate outside the structures of\\n checks and balances and are exempt from many constitutional demands and\\n federal statutes.\\n Public corporations have often been used as policy or organizational ex-\\n periments.625 They are thought to be an ideal vehicle to address various ar-\\n eas of public concern. They are owned by the government, operate like\\n businesses and have been used to build stadiums, operate airports and man-\\n age mass transit systems. If a public corporation fails, a new one can easily\\n be created.626\\n Like independent agencies, public corporations have been created in an\\n ad hoc manner.627 Their consistency lies in their independence, which has\\n often been a useful tool for Congress.

Government Sponsored Enterprices\\n Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) are even further removed\\n from governmental control than the public corporation. Examples of GSEs\\n are the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae),629 Student\\n Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae)630 and Federal Home Loan Mort-\\n gage Corporation (Freddie Mac).63\\'\\n GSEs were created in an effort to provide financing for groups that could\\n not obtain adequate service through private credit channels.632 These enti-\\n ties create secondary markets in which primary lenders\\' interests in ob-\\n taining funds are integrated with the capital markets\\' supply of money.633\\n The structure of GSEs combines the characteristics of both private and\\n public organizations. The GSE is under private ownership, but it operates\\n under government supervision and exists to serve the public interests man-\\n dated by Congress. Also, GSEs are governed by federal charter rather than\\n articles of incorporation,634 and are not directly managed by the govern-\\n ment.635 The GSEs are not subject to the FOIA or SEC registration re-\\n 629. See 12 U.S.C. § 1716 (1994).\\n 630. See 20 U.S.C. § 1087-2 (1994).\\n 631. See 12 U.S.C. § 1452 (1994). Other examples of GSEs include the Federal Agri-\\n cultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac), 12 U.S.C. § 2279aa-1 (1994); the Federal\\n Home Bank Loan System, 12 U.S.C. § 1421 (1994); and the Farm Credit System, 12 U.S.C.\\n § 2001 (1994).\\n 632. See Carrie Stradley Lavargna, Government-Sponsored Enterprises Are \"Too Big to\\n Fail\": Balancing Public and Private Interests, 44 HASTINGS L.J. 991, 997 n.23 (1993)\\n (\"Congress has chartered eleven enterprises to finance sectors of society that had not been\\n adequately served by the private credit markets, including housing, agriculture, and educa-\\n tion.\"). Congress continues to consider the creation of new enterprises to support markets\\n that are inadequately serviced by the public. See id. (citing Udayan Gupta, Venture Capi-\\n talists Raised 75% More Money Last Year, WALL ST. J., Jan. 29, 1993, at B2). The GSEs\\n purchase loans from primary lenders and create portfolios by pooling the loans. They es-\\n sentially convert the mortgages into tradeable securities which are sold to investors in the\\n capital market.\\n 633. See Lavargna, supra note 632, at 997-98 (describing creation of secondary markets\\n that facilitate flow of credit to lenders).\\n 634.

Stanton, Government-Sponsored Enterprises as\\n Federal Instrumentalities: Reconciling Private Management with Public Accountability, 49\\n PUB. ADMIN. REv. 321, 323 (1989).\\n The federal government\\'s control over an institution differs significantly depending\\n on whether that institution is an agency or instrumentality. The government manages\\n an agency directly through the federal management hierarchy. As a general rule, an\\n agency is subject to . ... federal procurement laws, and to the federal budget and other\\n direct federal management controls. By contrast, an instrumentality is a privately\\n owned institution that is supervised but not directly managed by the government.\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n quirements, are exempt from the bankruptcy code, are immune from provi-\\n sions under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and are exempt from state and lo-\\n cal income taxes. They are able to borrow at lower rates than private cor-\\n poration, but despite the belief of many, they are not backed by the full\\n faith and credit of the United States.\\n This said, the GSE resembles the independent agency in several respects.\\n For example, Congress uses GSEs to insulate programs from the executive\\n branch, which ultimately has allowed Congress greater control over the en-\\n * 636\\n tities.   Although the President retains the power to appoint and remove\\n the directors authorized by statute,637 he does not have the ability to remove\\n directors that he has not appointed without specific statutory authoriza-\\n * 631\\n tion.\\n The fact that these GSEs are privately held with public purposes has\\n caused intense debate as to whether or not they are making the most of the\\n governmental benefits that they receive. The GSEs receive an indirect\\n governmental subsidy since they are able to avoid many of the expenses\\n incurred by commercial lenders.639 Although GSEs were originally estab-\\n lished to address problems in specific sections of the capital market, many\\n are currently seeking ways to infiltrate the primary market. This perceived\\n interest to expand into primary markets and the lack of congressional ac-\\n countability has led many commentators to believe that privatization may\\n be the only means by which the GSEs will be \"forced to face the full costs\\n of competition\" in the primary markets.640\\n Id. at 323.\\n 636.

Vern McKinley, Defining the Mission, AEI Conference Summaries (visited July 25,\\n 2000)  [hereinafter Defining the Mission].\\n The charters of the GSEs are phrased in ambiguous terms, leaving them a good deal\\n of latitude to expand their activities. Currently the GSEs appear to be broadening\\n their business through nonmortgage investments, subprime mortgages, computer-\\n based automated underwriting, and mortgage insurance. The GSEs argue that these\\n new activities are within their charters and are also beneficial to homeownership and\\n homeowners. Potential competitors would like to see the GSEs restricted to their\\n original activities....\\n McKinley argued that the GSEs\\' profit-related expansion should be held in check by\\n regulators such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Office\\n of Federal Housing Enterprises Oversight... Since these groups in addition to Con-\\n \\n 20001\\n \\n 1233\\n \\n  \\n ADMINISTRATIVE LAW REVIEW\\n \\n Despite these concerns, certain properties of the government-sponsored\\n enterprise suggest that the existence of these quasi-governmental entities\\n will be guaranteed into the 21st century and beyond. Their freedom to act\\n with a level of autonomy outside of the normal bureaucratic channels has\\n allowed Congress the ability to effectuate public policy goals, through their\\n dominance of the secondary markets, without being directly accountable\\n for the actions of the entities. They have become an indispensable segment\\n of the American economy, providing them with a \"too big to fail\" status,\\n thus ensuring that they will continue to exist in one form or another.641\\n CONCLUSION\\n When Attorney General Tom C. Clark gave his endorsement to the draft\\n legislation that was to become the Administrative Procedure Act, he con-\\n cluded that the bill \"appears to offer a hopeful prospect of achieving rea-\\n sonable uniformity and fairness in administrative procedures without at the\\n same time interfering unduly with the efficient and economical operation of\\n the Government.\\'642  The emergence of the independent administrative\\n agencies reflect somewhat the same considerations. Of particular note in\\n this process is the development of the multi-member commissions, multi-\\n member supervisory agencies, and executive branch independent agencies,\\n and the development of their processes and their place in the administrative\\n state.643\\n The administrative process owes more to experience than doctrine. That\\n is especially true of the internal operations of agencies, where there is often\\n little more than ambiguous and incomplete legislation to govern or guide\\n agency practice. As in the constitutional realm, established practice is im-\\n gress have been unwilling or unable to limit the GSE expansion into new markets, the\\n Speaker proposes privatization.\\n Id.\\n 641.

A structure or practice that\\n begins as a means of simply solving a problem, or asserting power, or ex-\\n perimentally addressing a political dilemma, can either become accepted,\\n or challenged and rejected. But if accepted, the approach becomes a tradi-\\n tion; that tradition, over time, can take on the trappings of precedent and\\n eventually obtain the sanction of law.\\n In the past few decades we have seen a resurgence of efforts by various\\n administrations to centralize the administrative state. In part, this reflects\\n resurgent visions of presidential power exemplified by the theory of the\\n unitary executive. Notwithstanding the constitutional underpinnings of\\n some theory of a unitary -  that is to say centralized -  executive,645 there\\n are structural tensions in the modem administrative state that appear to\\n keep the independent mode alive. The administrative state is too protean\\n for the executive to always desire, or indeed always be able, to patrol all its\\n far reaches. And, Congress is too balkanized to effectively control at all\\n times thorugh oversight and legislation.646 Indeed, on occasion, both Con-\\n gress and the President have found it necessary to consciously forgo ac-\\n countability in order to advance important agendas, as evidenced by the\\n Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990.647 Ironically, this dif-\\n fusion of accountability and control may serve to increase presidential\\n power by allowing the President to better manage political conflict.648\\n The independent agency form has undergone various structural changes\\n 644. See, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 967 (1983) (White, J., dissenting) (ques-\\n tioning holding that struck down legislative veto placed in nearly 200 statutes over five dec-\\n ades).\\n 645.

It is our\\n view that in the next century, the function filled by the independent agency\\n will also be filled, from time-to time, by public corporations, GSEs, and\\n what the British quaintly call quangos, as Congress continues to experi-\\n ment with institutional arrangements.650 This blurring of public and private\\n regulatory roles is reflective of a general shift toward a more porous under-\\n standing of the public/private distinction in American jurisprudence.\\n In 1835, during debates over the power of the President to remove the\\n Secretary of the Treasury summarily, Daniel Webster was of the view that,\\n as an original proposition, he would not have accorded the President that\\n power.

Under the Mine Act,\\n the Department of Labor has specific litigating authority in the areas of in-\\n junctive relief and enforcement of Commission orders and decisions.9\\n The Commission has subpoena enforcement authority in the United States\\n District Courts.792 Litigation involving personnel matters, although rare,\\n has been and would be handled by the Office of the General Counsel. The\\n Commission has not had occasion to be involved in Freedom of Informa-\\n tion Act and Sunshine Act lawsuits. In such lawsuits, however, defense\\n would be coordinated between the Commission\\'s Office of General Coun-\\n sel and the Department of Justice.\\n 789. Id. § 2700.8 1(c).\\n 790.

No\\n more than three commissioners may be from one political party. Commis-\\n sioners may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty,\\n or malfeasance in office.\\n Quorum and Voting Requirements: There is no statutory quorum re-\\n quirement. However, under Commission rules, a quorum is a majority of\\n the members.794 When a majority does not form for or against a motion\\n within one month of the most recent vote cast, the motion fails for lack of a\\n majority. The Commission\\'s rules do not authorize proxy voting but per-\\n mit Commissioners to direct members of their staffs to report their vote.\\n Review of an ALJ decision is not discretionary but is required where a\\n party has filed a timely notice of appeal.

The executive and administrative functions of the Com-\\n mission are vested in the Chairman subject to the general policies estab-\\n lished by the Commission. Appointment of heads of various major admin-\\n istrative units is subject to approval of the Commission. The Commission\\n has authorization to revise budget estimates and to determine the distribu-\\n tion of appropriated funds.

The Board\\n also reviews certain significant actions by the Office of Personnel Man-\\n agement, such as regulations, and conducts studies of the merit system.04\\n The MSPB was established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.805\\n Membership: The Board consists of a Chairman, a Vice Chairman, and a\\n Member, with no more than two of its members from the same political\\n party. Board members are appointed by the President, confirmed by the\\n Senate, and serve overlapping non-renewable seven-year terms. Members\\n whose terms expire may continue to serve until a successor is appointed\\n and qualified but the extension is limited to one year. Members can be re-\\n moved only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\\n Quorum and Voting Requirements: Two of the Board\\'s three members\\n constitute a quorum.

The Board has no\\n provision for operation with only one member.\\n Disqualification and Recusal Procedure: Individual members of the\\n Board decide questions of recusal or disqualification.\\n Chairman\\'s Powers: The Chairman serves as chief executive and ad-\\n ministrative officer of the Board. The Chairman has authority to appoint\\n senior staff and prepare the Board\\'s budget without the approval of the\\n Board. The Board may delegate \"the performance of any of its functions\"\\n to a Board employee.06\\n OMB Bypass Provisions: The Board may transmit information to Con-\\n gress without prior OMB clearance.07 Legislative recommendations, and\\n budget requests and proposals, are transmitted simultaneously to the Presi-\\n dent and Congress.808\\n Litigation Authority: Board attorneys may represent the Board except as\\n to matters in the Supreme Court. However, the Department of Justice han-\\n dles cases of common concern to all agencies, such as Freedom of Infor-\\n mation Act litigation.\\n NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION\\n Mission and General Statutory Reference: The National Credit Union\\n Administration (NCUA) supervises, examines and insures federal credit\\n unions, and those state credit unions that apply and qualify for insurance.809\\n Membership: The NCUA Board (the Board) is comprised of three mem-\\n bers who are \"broadly representative of the public interest,\" have \"educa-\\n tion, training or experience\" in financial services, and are appointed by the\\n President to six-year terms with the advice and consent of the Senate.10\\n 806.

Any Board\\n member may continue to serve after the expiration of his or her term until a\\n successor is qualified. The President designates a Chairman and the Board\\n may designate one of its members as Vice Chairman.\\n Quorum and Voting Requirements: A majority of the Board constitutes a\\n quorum. 812 The agreement of two of the three members is required for\\n Board action. There is no statutory or regulatory provision that prohibits a\\n majority of the Board from issuing its decision if the minority delays com-\\n pleting a dissenting statement. Although a Board member who disagrees\\n with a decision may state such disagreement at a meeting, written dissent-\\n ing statements are not issued. Proxy voting is prohibited.\\n Disqualification and Recusal Procedure: No special procedures.\\n Chairman\\'s Powers: The Chairman is the spokesman for the Board, rep-\\n resents the Board and the NCUA in its official relations with other\\n branches of government, determines each member\\'s area of responsibility\\n and reviews such assignments biannually. The Chairman is the presiding\\n officer at meetings and makes procedural rulings, although, upon appeal, a\\n majority decision by the Board determines any disputed ruling.\\n The authority to appoint senior staff, with the exception of each board\\n member\\'s personal staff, is reserved to the Board. However, the Chairman\\n does have the authority to select the Executive Director given the prior\\n agreement by the Board. The Chairman also maintains the authority for all\\n Board human resource decisions in the event of an emergency. Any such\\n actions taken by the Chairman will remain effective for thirty days or until\\n the next closed Board meeting. Budget approval authority is reserved to\\n the Board. The Executive Director, reporting to the Chairman, may ap-\\n prove the reprogramming of up to $150,000 of budget amounts per quarter\\n under powers delegated by the Board, given that all necessary circum-\\n stances are met.\\n \\n 811.

Otherwise, the Department of Justice is responsible for the\\n conduct of federal court litigation brought by or against the NCUA in its\\n capacity as a federal agency.\\n NATIONAL INDIAN GAMING COMMISSION\\n Mission and General Statutory Reference: The National Indian Gaming\\n Commission (NIGC) is an independent agency established within the De-\\n partment of the Interior and administers a comprehensive system of regula-\\n tion of gambling activities on Indian lands. Among other things, it moni-\\n tors gaming operations, approves all contracts for the management of such\\n operations by non-tribal parties, conducts background investigations on\\n management company officials and principal investors, audits the books\\n and records of gaming operations, and brings enforcement action to ensure\\n compliance with the statute and regulations.814\\n Membership: Three members serve three-year terms. Members may\\n serve until a successor is appointed. The Chairman is appointed by the\\n President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The two remaining\\n Commissioners are appointed by the Secretary of the Interior. Two mem-\\n bers must be enrolled in an Indian tribe. No more than two Commissioners\\n can be of the same political party. The Commission selects its own Vice\\n Chairman.\\n Quorum and Voting Requirements: Two members are required to con-\\n stitute a quorum. The effect of a tie vote depends on the particular matter\\n before the Commission. For example, if the Commission were voting on\\n whether to promulgate a rule, a tie vote would result in no rule being prom-\\n ulgated. In other circumstances, however, a tie vote may allow a Chair-\\n man\\'s decision to stand or require the Chairman to take different actions to\\n obtain the desired results. There is no proxy voting; however, members\\n may participate in meetings via telephone. The Commission is responsible\\n 813. See 12 U.S.C. § 250 (1994).\\n 814.

Staff assistance is available to dissenters upon re-\\n quest. The Commission\\'s manual delegates certain authorities. Addition-\\n ally, the Chairman delegates by memorandum.\\n Disqualification and Recusal Procedure: No special procedures.\\n Chairman\\'s Powers: The Chairman may issue orders temporarily closing\\n gaming activities; levy and collect civil fines for violations of the Indian\\n Gaming Regulatory Act, its implementing regulations; and tribal gaming\\n ordinances, approve tribal gaming ordinances; and approve gaming man-\\n agement contracts.815 The Chairman is also responsible for appointing and\\n supervising Commission staff. The Commission, upon recommendation by\\n the Chairman, has power to approve the Commission\\'s annual budget.816\\n The Commission also has authority to establish fees to be paid to the\\n Commission by certain gaming activity.817\\n OMB Bypass Provisions: Any request for appropriations is subject to the\\n approval of the Secretary of the Interior and is included as part of the\\n budget request of the Department.818\\n Litigation Authority: The Department of Justice represents the Commis-\\n sion in the federal courts.\\n NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD\\n Mission and General Statutory Reference: The National Labor Relations\\n Board (the Board) conducts secret-ballot elections to determine whether\\n employees want union representation and investigates and adjudicates\\n claims of unfair labor practices by employers and unions.819\\n Membership: Five members serve staggered five-year terms and are ap-\\n pointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The\\n statute is silent on party membership but by tradition two of the five seats\\n on the Board have been reserved for individuals who are not members of\\n 815. See 25 U.S.C. § 2705(a) (1994).\\n 816.  See id. § 2706(a)(1).\\n 817. See 25 U.S.C. § 2717(a)(1)(1994 & Supp. IV 1998).\\n 818.  See 25 U.S.C. § 2717(b)(3) (1994).\\n 819.

There is no provision for members to serve after\\n their terms expire pending the appointment of a new member, although\\n members are eligible for reappointment. The President may remove a\\n member, upon notice and hearing, for neglect of duty or malfeasance in of-\\n fice, but not for any other cause.\\n Other Presidential Appointees: General Counsel. The President also ap-\\n points a General Counsel with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a\\n term of four years. The General Counsel has final authority to investigate\\n charges and institute complaints involving unfair labor practices.820 He\\n also exercises general supervision over all attorneys employed by the\\n Board (other than ALJs and legal assistants to Board members) and the of-\\n ficers and employees of the thirty-three regional offices.82\\' He also has\\n such other duties as may be delegated by the Board. Appeals from deci-\\n sions of regional directors for the failure to institute an unfair labor practice\\n complaint are of right and go to the General Counsel or his or her designee.\\n Appeals of a regional director\\'s decision not to proceed on a representation\\n petition are discretionary and lie with the Board.\\n Quorum and Voting Requirements: Three members constitute a quorum\\n for purposes of taking Board action and two members constitute a quorum\\n of three-member panels.822 In those instances where the Board has fallen\\n below three members, the Board has declined to rule on pending contested\\n matters until a third member has been appointed. Inasmuch as the statute\\n provides for five Board members with three constituting a quorum, tie\\n votes generally occur only when there is one vacancy on the Board or when\\n a member is disqualified from participating. The Board members do not\\n vote on whether to take review of a decision by an ALJ because an appeal\\n from such a decision is a matter of right.823 Since 1976 the Board has had a\\n procedure that permits majority decisions to be issued without awaiting a\\n dissenting opinion in the event that the dissenting opinion was not circu-\\n lated in a timely manner (generally four weeks from approval of the major-\\n ity draft). However, this procedure has never actually been implemented in\\n any case. The statute provides that each member shall have his or her own\\n staff of attorneys to review cases and prepare drafts of opinions, and mem-\\n bers routinely rely on their staffs for assistance in drafting both majority\\n and dissenting opinions. The statute permits the Board to delegate any or\\n 820. See 29 U.S.C. § 153(d) (1994).\\n 821. Id.\\n 822. See id. § 153(b).\\n 823.

Board pro-\\n cedures assure personal participation of the Board members in the decision\\n of all other contested issues, and subordinates are not issued general prox-\\n ies with respect to such matters.\\n Disqualification and Recusal Procedure: Individual Board members de-\\n cide questions of recusal or disqualification.825\\n Chairman\\'s and General Counsel\\'s Powers: The President designates\\n one member to serve as Chairman. The statute is silent as to the Chair-\\n man\\'s authority. As a practical matter, all key decisions, such as approval\\n of the budget and the appointment and removal of some senior staff, are\\n made by the Board collegially. The General Counsel investigates alleged\\n unfair labor practices and prosecutes unfair labor practice complaints.826\\n The General Counsel has unreviewable discretion to decline to issue unfair\\n labor practice complaints. The General Counsel also has direct authority\\n over NLRB regional office employees.827\\n OMB Bypass Provisions: The Board does not assert a budgetary or leg-\\n islative bypass of OMB review.\\n Litigation Authority: The Board enjoys independent litigating authority\\n under its statute.828 The Board also handles its own FOIA and EAJA liti-\\n gation. The Department of Justice is involved in Supreme Court litigation\\n and non-program litigation, such as tort claims and other suits for damages.\\n NATIONAL MEDIATION BOARD\\n Mission and General Statutory Reference: The National Mediation\\n Board (the Board) is an independent agency in the executive branch of the\\n Government that mediates disputes for the airline and railroad industries.\\n Strikes, lockouts and other forms of self-help in these industries may occur\\n 824.

No more than two members\\n may be of the same political party. Individuals appointed to fill a vacancy\\n may only serve for the unexpired portion of the term. Members may serve\\n after expiration of their term until a successor is qualified. Members may\\n be removed by the President for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance\\n A,30\\n in office, or ineligibility, but for no other cause.\\n Quorum and Voting Requirements: Two members constitute a quorum.\\n Disqualification and Recusal Procedure: No specific procedures.\\n Chairman\\'s Powers: The Board annually selects its own chairman.3\\'\\n The Board may delegate \"any portion of its work, business, or functions\" to\\n an individual Board member or staff member.832\\n OMB Bypass Provisions: The Board sends its annual appropriation re-\\n quest to the OMB for approval and inclusion in the President\\'s budget.\\n The Board also submits testimony and legislative recommendations to\\n OMB for clearance.\\n Litigation Authority: The Department of Justice represents the Board in\\n the federal courts.\\n NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD\\n Mission and General Statutory Reference: The National Transportation\\n Safety Board (the Board) is an independent establishment of the United\\n States Government that investigates all civil and most public aircraft acci-\\n dents and significant accidents in other modes of transportation. It also\\n serves as an adjudicatory body providing administrative trial and appellate\\n review of decisions by the Federal Aviation Administration, assessing civil\\n penalties, and reviewing decisions by the Federal Aviation Administration\\n 829.

No more than three Board members may be of\\n the same political party.34 At any given time, no fewer than three members\\n of the Board must be individuals who have been \"appointed on the basis of\\n technical qualification, professional standing, and demonstrated knowledge\\n in accident reconstruction, safety engineering, human factors, transporta-\\n tion safety, or transportation regulation.\"835 Any individual appointed to\\n fill a vacancy occurring on the.Board prior to the expiration of the term of\\n office for which his predecessor was appointed is appointed for the remain-\\n der of that term. Upon the expiration of his term of office, a member shall\\n continue to serve until his successor is appointed and shall have qualified.\\n Any member of the Board may be removed by the President for ineffi-\\n ciency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\\n Quorum and Voting Requirements: Three members of the Board con-\\n stitute a quorum for the transaction of any function of the Board,36 and of-\\n ficial action can be taken by a majority of a quorum. Although the Board\\n permits proxy voting, a proxy may not be used to establish a quorum for a\\n Board meeting. Official action can be taken at a Board meeting or by no-\\n tation. Items discussed at a meeting are usually adopted or disapproved by\\n voice vote at the meeting. However, a member who will be absent from\\n the meeting may request that the Chairman hold the record open for his or\\n her later vote, and in such cases adoption or disapproval would not occur at\\n the Board meeting. An absent member may vote by proxy. The proxy\\n must include the member\\'s voting intent and the holder of the proxy deter-\\n mines whether any changes to the item at the board meeting has not af-\\n fected the item that the proxy should not be voted. Any member can\\n change his or her vote, or \"recalendar\" an item for discussion within\\n twenty-four hours of the Board\\'s vote. When the Board is equally divided,\\n no official action can be taken. Where official action is taken, a member\\n can file a dissenting or concurring statement. The member\\'s special assis-\\n tant or the Board\\'s staff are available to assist in its drafting.37 The Board\\n 833. See 49 U.S.C. §§ 1101-1155 (1994 & Supp. IV 1998).\\n 834.

The President, without Senate confirmation, also designates an in-\\n dividual to serve as Vice Chairman. The term of Chairman and Vice\\n Chairman is two years. The Chairman is the chief executive and adminis-\\n trative officer of the Board. When necessary, the Vice Chairman is\\n authorized to act as Chairman.842 The Chairman of the Board selects key\\n staff officials. Such selections are not subject to the approval of the other\\n Board members, although in practice, the Chairman often consults with\\n senior career employees before making his selections.

Among other things, the NRC licenses the construction and op-\\n eration of nuclear reactors and other nuclear facilities, and the possession,\\n use, processing, handling and export of nuclear material.847\\n Membership: Five members serve staggered five-year terms and are ap-\\n pointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. No\\n more than three commissioners may belong to the same political party.48\\n There is no provision for members to sit after their term has expired.

Others are named\\n by the Chairman, after consultation with the Executive Director, subject to\\n the approval of the Commission. The function of appointing, removing,\\n and supervising the staff of various offices, such as the General Counsel,\\n are delegated by the reorganization plan to the respective heads of these of-\\n fices. All Commission functions pertaining to an emergency at a requested\\n facility are specifically vested in the Chairman. Development of budget\\n estimates for Commission consideration lies with the Chairman but the\\n Commission must approve budget proposals for submission to OMB.53\\n OMB Bypass Provisions: The Commission asserts a legislative bypass,\\n which describes the Commission as an independent regulatory agency.54\\n However, the Commission does submit its authorization and appropriations\\n legislative proposals for clearance. It does not acknowledge clearance\\n authority by OMB in any other matters, including bills, supporting testi-\\n mony and legislative reports.\\n Litigation Authority: The Commission has litigation authority to repre-\\n sent itself in the Courts of Appeals.855 The Commission works with the\\n 849.

Mem-\\n bers are chosen from among persons who are qualified by reason of train-\\n ing, education, or experience to carry on the functions of the Commission.\\n A vacancy caused by death, resignation, or removal of a member prior to\\n the expiration of the term for which the member was appointed shall be\\n filled only for the remainder of the unexpired term. A member of the\\n Commission may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of\\n duty, or malfeasance in office. The President shall designate one of the\\n members as Chairman. There is no provision for a Vice Chairman.\\n Ouorum and Voting Requirements: Two of the Commission\\'s three\\n members constitute a quorum. Official action can be taken only on the af-\\n firmative vote of at least two members. An ALJ, appointed by the Com-\\n mission, decides proceedings instituted before the Commission. The deci-\\n sion of the ALJ becomes the final order of the Commission within thirty\\n days, unless any individual Commissioner directs, within that period, that\\n the ALJ\\'s decision be reviewed by the full Commission. An ALJ\\'s decision\\n goes into effect if a Commissioner does not specify review of the ALJ\\'s\\n decision. The Commission has no regulations governing proxy voting.\\n Disqualification and Recusal Procedure: The question of disqualification\\n of a Commission member is left to the member concerned.57\\n Chairman\\'s Powers: The Chairman is responsible for the administrative\\n operations of the Commission. The Chairman appoints ALJs and other\\n employees as she deems necessary to assist in the performance of the\\n Commission\\'s functions, and fixes their compensation according to law.\\n 856. See 29 U.S.C. § 661 (1994).\\n 857. See, e.g., National Mfg. Co., 8 O.S.H. Cas.

Com-\\n missioners are chosen on the basis of professional qualifications and may\\n be removed only for cause. No more than three commissioners may be af-\\n filiated with the same political party.59\\n Quorum and Voting Requirements: The Commission follows the rule\\n that a majority constitutes a quorum and that action may be taken by a ma-\\n jority of the quorum. There are no statutory provisions governing the con-\\n duct of meetings. No decisions are delegated to staff offices. The Com-\\n mission, which employs no ALJs or other subordinate hearing officers, sits\\n en banc in cases set for hearing and issues its decision directly following\\n briefing and oral argument. Additionally, the Commission has authority to\\n make rules and regulations and to establish procedures, subject to the Ad-\\n ministrative Procedure Act, and take any other action necessary and proper\\n to perform its functions, free of supervision by the Postal Service.6° When\\n the membership is equally divided, a positive action may not ensue. Com-\\n mission decisions are governed by strict statutory time limits and, by prac-\\n tice, the Commission puts primary emphasis on publishing all its decisions\\n within these time frames. In theory, a dissent may issue after a majority\\n decision, but this has not occurred. A dissenting member may get staff as-\\n 858. See 39 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3604 (1994).

The Commission annually elects a\\n Vice-Chairman from among its members.861 The Chairman is the principal\\n executive officer of the Commission. He is responsible for the appoint-\\n ment of personnel, except heads of major administrative units whose ap-\\n pointments must be approved by a majority the Commission, the supervi-\\n sion of personnel, the assignment of work, and the use and expenditure of\\n funds.862 The Chairman may appoint all other employees, generally does\\n not seek the advice of the Commission prior to hiring these individuals, and\\n may assign responsibilities to employees within the agency. Each commis-\\n sioner is consulted during the internal process of developing a draft budget\\n and the budget is considered and approved at a public meeting.\\n OMB Bypass Provisions: The Commission is not subject to normal\\n budget procedures because all its operating expenses are obtained from the\\n Postal Service Fund.863 It does not submit budget requests to OMB or\\n Congress. Rather, it submits all budget requests to the Governors of the\\n United States Postal Service for approval and receives payment from the\\n Postal Service Fund. The Commission participates in OMB review as a\\n matter of long standing practice, though such review is not binding on the\\n Commission. Thus, the Commission supplies reports on legislation as re-\\n quested by OMB and submits its draft reports on legislation to OMB when\\n they are requested by members of Congress.\\n Litigation Authority: The Commission has no special statutory litigation\\n authority, and is, in the absence of special arrangements, represented by the\\n Attorney General. Referrals to the Department of Justice are handled in-\\n formally. Commission legal personnel prepare or help prepare pleadings\\n and otherwise assist the Department of Justice. Special arrangements have\\n been made where the Commission and the Postal Service were on opposite\\n sides of a controversy. In one such case, the Department of Justice decided\\n to present the Postal Service position, but attached a memorandum giving\\n the Commission\\'s opposite view. In another situation, the Department of\\n 861. See id § 3601(d).\\n 862. See id. § 3604(a).\\n 863.

However, the Board is subject to the Sunshine Act and the\\n Freedom of Information Act.\\n Membership: Three members serve staggered five-year terms and are\\n appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. One\\n member is appointed based on the recommendations of railway labor; one\\n member is appointed based on the recommendations of railway manage-\\n ment; and one, the Chairman, is appointed without recommendation from\\n either railway labor or management. The Chairman must not be in the em-\\n ployment of or be financially or otherwise interested in any railroad em-\\n ployer or railroad labor organization. A member serves until a successor\\n has been appointed and confirmed.\\n Other Presidential Appointees: Inspector General.866\\n Quorum and Voting Requirements: A quorum of the Board consists of a\\n majority of those members in office.867 However, all rules, regulations or\\n decisions of the Board require the approval of two members.868 The ma-\\n jority will generally permit a dissenting member to prepare any dissenting\\n statement before issuing the majority opinion. A Board member can obtain\\n staff assistance in drafting any dissent. Authority is delegated to subordi-\\n nate officials of the Board by Board Order.\\n Disqualification and Recusal Procedure: No specific provisions.\\n 864. See 45 U.S.C. § 231f(1994 & Supp. IV 1998).\\n 865. See 5 U.S.C. § 551(l)(E) (1994 & Supp. IV 1998).\\n 866.

Appointment and removal\\n of senior staff officers is by the Board collegially.

These appeals are\\n handled by the legal staff of the Board.\\n SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\\n Mission and General Statutory Reference: The Securities and Exchange\\n Commission (the Commission) administers the federal securities laws, and\\n regulates firms engaged in the purchase or sale of securities, investment\\n companies, and people who provide investment advice.72\\n Membership: Five members serve staggered five-year terms873 and are\\n appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. No\\n more than three Commissioners can be of the same political party. In\\n making appointments, members of different political parties are to be ap-\\n pointed alternately as nearly as is practicable. A member may serve until\\n his or her successor is appointed and has qualified up to the expiration of\\n the next session of Congress subsequent to the expiration of the term. No\\n provision is made for a member\\'s removal.\\n 869. Seeid. §231f(f).\\n 870. See Exec. Order No. 12,866, 3 C.F.R. 638 (1993), reprinted in 5 U.S.C. § 601, at\\n 557 (1994).\\n 871.

In 1995, the Commission adopted a rule that\\n provides that a quorum consists of three members; provided, however, that\\n if the number in office is less than three, a quorum consists of the number\\n of members in office; and provided further that on any matters of business\\n as to which the number of members in office, minus the number of mem-\\n bers who are disqualified to consider such matter, is two, then two mem-\\n bers constitute a quorum for purposes of such matter.874 The effect of a tie\\n vote depends on the particular matter before the Commission. For exam-\\n ple, if the Commission were voting on whether to promulgate a rule or\\n bring an enforcement action, a tie vote would result in no rule being prom-\\n ulgated and no action being brought. However, if the Commission were\\n reviewing a sanction imposed by an AU in an administrative proceeding, a\\n tie vote would result in the dismissal of the proceeding.\\n Disqualification and Recusal Procedure: Each commissioner decides the\\n question for himself or herself. The Commission\\'s rules provide that a\\n Commissioner \"should disqualify himself in the event he obtained knowl-\\n edge prior to becoming a member of the facts at issue before him in a\\n quasi-judicial proceeding, or in other types of proceeding in any matter in-\\n volving parties in which he has any interest or relationship directly or indi-\\n rectly.\\'875\\n Chairman\\'s Powers: There is no statutory reference to the selection of a\\n Chairman. However, under section 3 of the Reorganization Plan No. 10 of\\n 1950,876 the function of the Commission with respect to choosing a Chair-\\n man from among the members was transferred to the President. The Reor-\\n ganization Plan also transferred to the Chairman from the Commission the\\n administrative and executive functions of the Commission, including the\\n appointment and supervision of personnel, the distribution of business, and\\n the use and expenditure of funds. Appointment by the Chairman of the\\n heads of major administrative units is subject to the approval of the Com-\\n mission. The Chairman is to be governed by general policies established\\n by the Commission and by regulatory decisions, findings, and determina-\\n tions as the Commission may by law make.

The SEC submits its appropriations request to OMB for\\n approval.\\n Litigation Authority: The Commission has independent litigation\\n authority and handles litigation with its own attorneys at both the trial and\\n appellate levels.818 In the Supreme Court, the Commission participates\\n through the Office of the Solicitor General. The Commission\\'s litigation\\n authority is contained in a number of statutes. For instance, section 21(d)\\n of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, authorizes the Commission to\\n initiate actions in Federal court to obtain injunctions and other regulated\\n entities.879 In administrative proceedings, the Act authorizes the Commis-\\n sion to issue cease and desist orders to enforce the requirements of the Se-\\n curities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act,\\n and the Investment Advisors Act. The act also provides for temporary or-\\n ders that are designed to prevent the dissipation or conversion of assets or\\n significant harm to investors.880  The Commission also defends actions\\n brought against it or its current or former members and employees for acts\\n arising from the performance of their duties.\\n The Commission has authority to seek remedies for violations of the\\n Act. The Commission is also authorized to seek writs of mandamus and\\n other orders, and to enforce its subpoenas.881 The Securities Enforcement\\n Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990,882 authorizes the Commis-\\n sion to seek civil money penalties in district court actions and to impose\\n money penalties in administrative proceedings brought against broker deal-\\n ers, investment advice.

Moreover, un-\\n der the so-called Hobbs Act, the Board is authorized to appear as a party in\\n its own right in any proceeding involving the validity of any Commission\\n order or requirement.887 The Board also has authority to initiate and litigate\\n enforcement actions in courts independently of the Department of Justice,\\n pursuant to 49 U.S.C. §§ 11702, 14702 and 15902.\\n UNITED STATES INTERNA TIONAL TRADE COMMISSION\\n Mission and General Statutory Reference: The United States Interna-\\n tional Trade Commission (ITC) determines the impact of imports on U.S.\\n industries and directs actions against certain unfair trade practices, such as\\n patent, trademark and copyright infringement.88 It investigates and pub-\\n lishes reports on U.S. industries and publishes and updates the Harmonized\\n Tariff Schedule of the United States.889\\n Membership: Six commissioners serve staggered nine-year terms and are\\n appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.

Unless otherwise provided for by statute, a tie vote is\\n the same as a \"no\" vote; the motion or other attempted action fails for lack\\n of majority. However, by statute, one half the number of Commissioners\\n voting can authorize the institution of an investigation and, in the case of an\\n equally divided Commission, under sections 201 and 406 of the Trade Act\\n of 1974, the President may consider the determination of either group of\\n Commissioners to be the determination of the Commission. In antidump-\\n ing and countervailing duty cases, by statute, an evenly divided Commis-\\n sion vote shall be treated as an affirmative determination. By published\\n Commission rule, a vote in favor of review by only one Commissioner is\\n all that is necessary to require review by the full Commission of all or part\\n of an initial determination of an ALJ in matters under section 337 of the\\n Tariff Act of 1930. The Commission majority may issue its determination\\n even if the minority delays in completing any dissenting statements. A dis-\\n senting Commissioner can obtain staff assistance in preparing any dissent-\\n ing views. There is no statutory provision for voting by proxy.

He may not designate for Chairman (1) a\\n Commissioner who has less than 1 year of continuous service as a commis-\\n sioner as of the date the designation is being made, or (2) a Commissioner\\n who is a member of the same political party as Chairman for the immedi-\\n ately preceding term. He may not name as Vice Chairman a member of the\\n same political party as the Chairman. If the President does not appoint a\\n Chairman by the beginning of the term, the Commissioner with the longest\\n period of continuous service as a commissioner who is of a different party\\n from the Chairman for the immediately preceding term will serve as\\n Chairman until a presidentially-designated Chairman takes office. If a\\n Commissioner does not complete a term as Chairman or Vice Chairman\\n due to certain specified causes, the president shall designate a Commis-\\n \\n 1290\\n \\n [52:4\\n \\n  \\n INDEPENDENT FEDERAL AGENCIES\\n \\n sioner of the same political party to serve the remainder of the term. The\\n Vice Chairman acts as Chairman in case of the absence or disability of the\\n Chairman. During any period in which there is no Chairman or Vice\\n Chairman, the Commissioner having the longest period of continuous\\n service as a commissioner shall act as Chairman.\\n The Chairman of the Commission is authorized to \"appoint and fix the\\n compensation of such employees of the Commission as he deems neces-\\n sary.\"\\'890 However, the Chairman\\'s decisions in this regard \"shall be sub-\\n ject to disapproval by a majority vote of all the commissioners in office.\"891\\n The Chairman\\'s appointment powers do not extend to the personal staff of\\n each Commissioner. The Chairman formalizes an annual budget that is\\n subject to the approval of a majority of all the commissioners.892\\n An Executive Resources Board (ERB) within the Commission recruits\\n and evaluates candidates for senior staff positions and makes recommenda-\\n tions to the Chairman who makes the final hiring decisions.893\\n OMB Bypass Provisions: The Commission is specifically excluded from\\n the provisions of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 and directs that\\n the Commission\\'s estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations be\\n included without revision in the President\\'s budget.894 Moreover, the\\n Commission asserts an informal legislative bypass and does not, conse-\\n quently, clear testimony or comments through OMB. Assertion of an in-\\n formal legislative bypass is based on 19 U.S.C. § 2232 which, besides pro-\\n viding the Commission with a budgetary bypass, states that the\\n Commission shall not be considered to be a department or establishment\\n for purposes of the Budget and Accounting Act.\\n Litigation Authority: Section 333(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 authorizes\\n the Commission to represent itself in judicial proceedings through its own\\n attorneys. Alternatively, the Commission can request that the Attorney\\n General represent it in such proceedings.\\n 890.  19 U.S.C. § 1331(a)(l)(A)(i) (1994).\\n 891.  Id. § 1331(a)(I)(C).\\n 892.

A successor appointed to fill an unexpired term serves only for the\\n remainder of the term. A Commissioner whose successor does not take of-\\n fice immediately after the Commissioner\\'s term may continue in office un-\\n til the successor assumes office. The Commissioner may be removed by\\n the President only for \"neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.\"896 A\\n Deputy Commissioner is also appointed by the President to a six-year term\\n with the advice and consent of the Senate but there is no provision for re-\\n moval.897 The Chief Actuary is appointed by the Commissioner but does\\n not have a fixed term, and may be removed only \"for cause.\"\\n Other Presidential Appointees: Inspector General.898 Deputy Commis-\\n sioner.899 Two of the members from the public who serve on the Board of\\n Trustees of the Trust Fund.900 Three of the seven members of the Social\\n Security Advisory Board.901\\n OMB Bypass Provisions: The Commissioner\\'s budget must be submit-\\n ted to Congress by the President without revision together with the Presi-\\n dent\\'s annual budget for the Administration.902 Legislative matters are\\n subject to OMB clearance and approval.\\n 895.

It is authorized to file complaints with the Merit System Protec-\\n tion Board seeking corrective action remedies, such as reinstatement and\\n back pay, and disciplinary action against individuals who commit prohib-\\n ited personnel practices. It also provides a secure channel through which\\n federal workers may disclose information about workplace improprieties,\\n misuse of funds, fraud and abuse, and substantial dangers to the public\\n -health or safety. OSC also provides advisory opinions on the Hatch Act\\n dealing with political activities by federal employees, and enforces the\\n Hatch Act before the MSPB.9°3\\n Appointment and Removal Provisions: The Special Counsel is appointed\\n by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate to a five-year\\n term. The Special Counsel may continue to serve for up to one year after\\n the date the term would otherwise expire if a successor has not yet been\\n appointed and confirmed. A successor appointed to fill an unexpired term\\n serves only for the remainder of the term. The successor must be \"an attor-\\n ney who, by demonstrated ability, background, training, or experience, is\\n especially qualified to carry out the functions of the position.\"90\\' The Spe-\\n cial Counsel may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, ne-\\n glect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\\n OMB Bypass Provisions: Freedom from OMB review is secured by a\\n provision for concurrent transmittal of reports and testimony to Congress\\n and the President or other executive branch agencies.9°5 However, as a\\n matter of practice, the Special Counsel has not used its OMB bypass\\n authority and, instead, sends its budget to OMB for inclusion in the Presi-\\n dent\\'s budget.\\n 903.
